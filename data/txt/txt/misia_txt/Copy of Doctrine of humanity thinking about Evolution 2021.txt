What about Science?

Defining our terms:
Many Christians who enter the fray point out that “evolution” is an ambiguous term, and that we can distinguish between “macro-evolution” (grand-scale body-plan transformation of species) and “micro-evolution” (observable small-scale changes within a population over succeeding generations).  This is a helpful clarification, but the term is used even more elastically than that, and it’s helpful to pull it apart to note the multiple ways it can be used.  In an essay on “The Meanings of Evolution,”  Stephen C. Meyer and Michael Newton Keas explain the six ways it is often used by scientists.  1-4 are helpful and meaningful in the understanding of our world.  5-6 move to a worldview that shuts out God and the supernatural from the discussion.  It is 5-6 that I am referring to in looking at evolution.  
Evolution as Change Over Time
Evolution as Gene Frequency Change 
Evolution as Limited Common Descent
Evolution as a Mechanism that Produces Limited Change or Descent with Modification




















  Can Darwinian Evolution Explain Human Origins?


It cannot explain causality (Where did everything begin?)
 Everything which just has a cause which is independent of that which began to exist. 

It cannot explain the reason  (Can you trust your brain? Why?)


It cannot explain individual rights  (Where do human rights derive?)


It cannot explain moral consciousness  (“Is” vs. “Ought”)



It cannot explain evil (Why bad things happen)

“My argument aainst god wasthat the universe seemd so cruel and unjust. but how had i got this idea of just and unjust? a man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. what was i comparing this universe with when i called it unjust?”

CS Lewis
