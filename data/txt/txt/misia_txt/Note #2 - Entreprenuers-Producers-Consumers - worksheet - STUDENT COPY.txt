UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS
GROUP 1:  ENTREPRENEURS, PRODUCERS, AND CONSUMERS
Entrepreneurs: (Def’n with examples)
 people who take a risk and start a business to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.
they often go into business to satisfy a need that is not being met in the marketplace
 businesses cannot exist without the people who start them, manage them, and work in them.

As a group come up with 3 entrepreneurs of companies whose products or services you use (clue:  think McDonald’s, Amazon.com, Facebook, etc.):
 Ray Kroc: Mcdonalds 
 Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook
 Steve Jobs: Apple 

Producers
 An individual or business that makes a product (good or service).

Consumer
 a person who buys goods and services, also known as a customer. 
 a person can be both a producer and consumer of a product.
 think of a computer-repair shop could build a computer and then use it to do their accounting on making them a consumer. 



GROUP 2:  GOODS AND SERVICES

Goods
most goods have monetary value that changes over time 
 the value ma increase over time if the good is valuable, rare, or collectable
 the value may decrease with use or time like a worn out pair of sneakers, a car, or a computer
 goods are considered a tangible item because they are produced and you can touch and feel them. 

Services
 services also have monetary value because people are willing to pay for them
 some services are unpaid ,such as those provided by volunteers
 they do not result in a product you can touch so they are considered intangible




As a group, list 3 services that companies offer that you as a teenager would use:
Apple - Apple care + 
 Fido -> W.F. / Data
Rogers -> Cable TV
Amazon Prime -> Fast shipping 


GROUP 3:  ESSENTIAL AND LUXURY GOODS AND SERVICES

Essential goods and services
 things we needs for survival
 essential goods include: food, clothing, shelter
 essential services include: heating, hydro, and water

Luxury goods and services
 things that are enjoyable but not necessary for survival
 luxury goods include: computers, swimming pools, ferraris
 luxury services include: visiting the spa, limousine rides, flying first class 

As a group come up with 1 good and 1 service that would be considered a luxury for teenagers and justify why they should be essential goods:


	Good #1:
	Justification: Laptop- schools say you need one




	Service #1
	Justification: Phone plan- so you can communicate with people and have access to emergency services.










GROUP 4:  ECONOMIC RESOURCES

 Economic resources or factors of production are means through which goods and services are made available to consumers
There are three kinds of economic resources:  _________________ , ___________________ , _______________



Natural Resources 
the raw materials that are used in production and that are often limited in quantity 
 soil, iron, gold, trees, naimal, water

  

Human Resources
the people who work to create the goods and services known as labour. 
 farmers, factory workers, teachers, nurses, designers



Capital Resources
 are the third factor of production and usually last for  along period of time and require substantial investment.
 buildings, equipment, tools, trucks, factories and money.



Do you think 1 resource is more important than another?  Explain.
Natural resources: without them, can't make anything
Entrepreneurship: without ideas, can do anything with the other 3
Capital resources: need money to do things 
Human resources: machines are taking over the world - don’t need people
