Chapter 6: The Musculoskeletal System

Tissues: Masses of cells that are similar in function and form
Muscle Tissue: A collection of cells that shorten during contraction which creates tension that causes bodily movement
Property of Muscle Fibers:
Irritability: Responds to stimuli
Contract: Shorten in Length
Extensibility: Extends in length
Elasticity: Stretches and retract back to its original position
Conductivity: Transmits nerve impulses
Three types of Muscle Tissue
Smooth Muscles
Surround internal organs
Contract more slowly than skeletal muscles but can remain contracted for a longer period of time
Muscles are made up of spindle-shaped fibres and arranged in dense sheets
Cardiac Muscles:
Found in the heart
Creates the pumping action that moves blood from the heart to the whole body
Contractions are involuntary
Muscles are striated
Skeletal Muscles: 
Muscles are attached to the bones by tendons and other tissues
Most common muscle type (30-40% of human body weight)
Contractions are voluntary 
Muscles are striated
Musculoskeletal System:
The body system that allows us to move
Comprised of the bones, skeletal muscles, and connective tissues that binds bones and muscles together
Purposes:
Support the body and keep it upright
Allow movement
Protect body’s vital organs
Agonist and Antagonist Muscle Pair
Muscles are usually arranged in pairs called Antagonistic Pairs
When one muscle contracts the other relaxes
Ex. Triceps relax while the bicep contracts to lift a weight 
Agonist: The muscle that is the primary mover of a body part
Antagonist: The counteracting muscle that lengthens
Complex movements involve many agonist and antagonist muscles paris as well as stabilizers
Stabilizer: Muscles that provide support and hold a joint in place while movement can occur at another joint


Homework: Choose 2 antagonistic pairs and create 4 exercises (2 pairs, 4 exercises)

Pairs: 

Deltoids/Lats

Lateral Raises, Pull Ups

Quadriceps, Hamstrings

Squats, Hamstring Single Leg Deadlifts

Origin, Insertion, and Function of Major Muscles and Muscle Groups
Skeletal muscles attach to bones either indirectly (via tendons) or directly (when the outer membrane of the muscle attaches to outer membrane of the bone)
Attachment via tendons is the more common between the two methods
When muscles contract, they cause the attached bones to move
Origin: The point where muscles attach to the more stationary bone that moves the most
Insertion: The point where muscles that attach to the bone that moves the most


Chapter 6: Muscle and Tendon Strains

Muscle Strains and Tears
Caused by excessive twisting and/or pulling on a muscle or tendon
Categorized into 3 degrees of severity 
First: Slight swelling and bruising, and pain is when a muscle is contracting or stretching
Second: Physiotherapy treatment is needed
Third: May require surgery and rehabilitation. 6-12 months to fully repair
Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)
NOT DUE TO LACTIC ACID
Microscopic tears within the muscle fibers
Usually caused when you begin a new workout routine or when you increase the duration or intensity
Peaks 1-3 days and disappears in 5-7 days
Tendonitis
Irritation of tendons due to overuse
Properly warming up and use of correct technique, and equipment can help avoid tendonitis

Chapter 6: Anatomy of the Skeletal Muscle and Role of the Nervous System

Skeletal muscles are made up of individual skeletal muscle fibers
These individual fibers are wrapped up in a sheath of connective tissue (perimysium)
These smaller bundles are further bundled together by a stronger sheath of tissue (epimysium)
The skeletal muscle will change its properties and become one with the tendon
The tendon attaches to the bone. This attachment occurs both at the muscle’s origin and insertion
Sarcolemma: A membrane that is beneath the epimysium that surrounds the muscle fibre and contains sarcoplasm
Sarcoplasm: The muscle cell’s cytoplasm that contains a higher concentration of calcium and mitochondria
Running along the length of the muscle fibers are myofibrils and myofibrils are made up of myofilaments
Within these myofibrils contain “thick” and “thin” filaments known as myosin and actin, respectively
Myosin and Actin are contained within repeating structural units called “Sarcomeres”
Myosin has a “head” and a “tail” like a golf club
The myosin “head” has an attachment site for actin, and actin has a binding site for the “head” of myosin
Actin has two proteins called: Troponin (binding site for Calcium) and Tropomyosin (covers the binding site on actin)

Chapter 6: Sliding Filament Theory

The myosin head does not attach to actin until calcium is released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum
Calcium binds with Troponin and Tropomyosin uncovers the binding site on actin so that the myosin head can bind to actin
ATP (energy molecule) comes and binds to the myosin head
ATP is broken down into ADP and P, which causes the myosin head to lock in place and bind to actin
This attach now forms the myosin cross bridges
ADP and P detach from the myosin “head”, and the myosin “head” slides producing a power stroke
The power stroke rotates the actin filament which causes the muscle to contract
The myosin head remains attached to the actin until a new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head
Contractions continue until the brain (or you) stops sending signals to make this muscle contraction
After you stop the activation, calcium will be removed from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Troponin and Tropomyosin will cover the binding sites on the actin filament
When muscles contract, the actin and myosin filaments overlap to one another to cause the sarcomere to shorten
Muscles will shorten (contract) and move the object if the load is light
The muscle will stay the same if the load is equal to the muscle strength


Chapter 6: Types of Muscle Contraction
Concentric Contraction
Occurs when muscles fibers shorten
Ex. Biceps shorten when lifting an object
Eccentric Contraction
Occurs when the muscle fibers lengthen
Ex. Biceps lengthen as the object is place on the ground
Isometric Contraction
Occurs when the fibers do not change in length
Ex. Trying to lift an immovable object


Chapter 6: Neuromuscular Junction and Motor Unit

Neuromuscular System: Describes the link between the muscular system and nervous system
Neuromuscular junction
The point where the nerve cells and muscle cells meet to perform movements
There is a gap between the neuromuscular junction and the sarcolemma
The nerve cell releases a neurotransmitter called “acetylcholine”, which binds to the receptors of the muscle
When acetylcholine binds to the receptors, it causes sodium ions to be released which causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions

Motor Unit: refers to a neuron, its pathway (axon), and the muscle fibers it stimulates
Some motor units cause fine motor movements which stimulate a small number of muscle fibers
Ex. Holding a pencil, moving your eyes, etc.
Some motor units cause gross motor movements that engage hundreds of muscle fibers to perform large movements
Ex. Jumping, throwing, catching, etc.
Motor units comply with the All-or-none principle
All or None Principle: Motor units will contract to its fullest potential when stimulated
Ex. if a motor unit has 10 muscle fibers, either all 10 will contract when “turned on” by a stimulus, or none will contract

Chapter 6: Reflexes, Proprioception, and Movement

Reflexes: Automatic and rapid responses to a particular stimulus
2 Pairs of Reflex Types:
Cerebral Reflexes: slower compared to spinal cord reflexes because information is relayed to the brain
Spinal Reflexes: Faster compared to cerebral reflex because information only needs to be relayed to the spinal cord
Autonomic Reflexes: Reflexes that are controlled by the autonomic division of the nervous system and usually involve smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands
Ex. Digestion, salvation, sweating
Ex. Pupillary light reflex. Adjustments of the pupil size in response to changes in the amount of light
Somatic Reflexes: Reflexes that are controlled by skeletal muscles by the somatic division of the nervous system
Ex. Knee jerk
Ex. Withdrawal reflex, Hand on a hot Stove

There are 3 types of neurons in the human body
Sensory Neurons: Detect information from the outside world (i.e heat, light, sound, touch)
Motor Neurons: Sends signals away form the CNS and causes a response (i.e. moving a leg or arm)
Interneurons: Form interconnections between other neurons in CNS

Reflex Arc: A neural pathway in the body that rapidly responds to inputs from sensory neurons
The stimulus from the sensory neurons sends a signal to the CNS, but there is little or no interpretation of the signal
The signal is transmitted to the motor neurons which causes a response

5 Components of the Reflex Arc

The Receptor: Receives the stimulus
Sensory Neuron: Sends an afferent (incoming) impulse to the spinal cord or brain
Interneuron (Adjuster): Interprets the signal from the sensory neuron and issues a response
Motor Neuron: Comes an efferent (outgoing) impulse to the muscle or organ through the spinal cord
The Effector: The muscle or organ that carries out the response

Proprioceptors: Sensory receptors found in muscles, tendons, joints, and the inner ear that detect the motion of position of the entire body or a limb
Provide sensory information about muscle contraction, body position, posture, and balance
Proprioceptor system operates using the following two sensory receipts
A) Muscle Spindles: Help muscle atomically adjust to changing conditions by constantly sending impulse to the spinal cord
Intramural muscle fibres: specialized muscle fibres that have 2 afferent neurons and 1 efferent neuron connected to it so that when changes occur, signals are relayed from the muscle to the spinal cord and back to initiate a motor response
Ex. Contraction of weight bearing muscles when sudden weight is added
B) Golgi tendon organs (GTO): Sensory receptors that attach where tendons join to muscle fibres
When a muscle stretches the GTOs activate and send an impulse along an afferent neuron to the CNS
The CNS sends an efferent signal via neurons to the stretched muscle and causes it to relax so that injury can be avoided
The GTO acgts as a tension detection device for the muscle system to protect muscles from damage
To develop strength and power, the obstacles presented by the GTO need to be overcome but within reasonable amounts to avoid injury
