7. Private Fraser believed that the majority of those who were decorated (awarded) during the war did “absolutely nothing out of the common” to earn the awards with which they were decorated. What does this tell us about the nature of the military as a wartime institution?
(2 marks)

This tells us that the living conditions were basically rock bottom. Having to try and live regularly right in the middle of a war, when shell shock effects, grenades, and gunshots can enter at any time was a very impressive feat. Especially because the trenches’ conditions were horrible as well, “nothing out of the common” was extremely impressive to maintain.
