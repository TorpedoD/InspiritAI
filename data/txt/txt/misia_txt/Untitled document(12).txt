 Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.

“Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.

I chose this passage today specifically because we have entered into the second semester, meaning the second half of the year, meaning that in just a few short months, school will be over. Specifically for the grade twelves, i know that this period will be extremely stressful as you will start to hear back from universities, as well as the fact that you are all graduating. I have chose this verse to remind everyone that we should be able to enjoy our lives despite there being uncertainty in the future, because if we spend all our time being anxious, we will miss out on all the fun memories we have left. If we put our faith in God, everything right will happen to all of us and we should all be able to live through days without too much anxiety. 

Dear heavenly father, we turn to you today to thank you for bringing us together for another student council meeting. I pray that you will be able to shift our minds to the more positive side of things, so that we may be able to enjoy every bit of life you have given to us. I pray for the grade 12s as they are going to go through their last second semester in highschool, and pray for me and yijoon and get through the semester as well. I hope that we will discuss a lot of things together today and we thank you for all you give for us everyday.
