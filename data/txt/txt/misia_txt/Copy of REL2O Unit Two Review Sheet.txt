Roles of the Trinity:

Creation is from the father, through the Son, by the Holy Spirit
The Father initiates salvation, the son accomplishes it, and the Spirit Applies it
We pray to the Father, in the name of the Son, by the power of the Holy Spirit

Heresy:

Definition: The choice to abandon the widely accepted teachings on an essential doctrine for one’s own view, to preach another gospel

Modalism: Emphasizes the oneness over the threeness. Modalism says that God exists in three modes (hence the name) at a time. But this is not true as God is 100% Father, Son, and Holy Spirit at ALL TIMES
Arianism: According to Arianism, The Father created Jesus and the Holy Spirit. But the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are equal
 Tri-theism: Emphasizes the threeness over oneness. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit are treated as 3 different Gods. But, God is all 3 at once, and of the same essence


Trinitarian Analogies:

Fire: Arianism because although there are 3 parts, heat and light depend on the flame

Water: Modalism because although they are three in one, they can’t be all three at the same time

Justin Trudeau: Modalism because although there are 3 roles of the same essence, roles depend on interactions

Clover: Tritheism because there are 3 parts but they’re separate

Optimus Prime: Modalism because although there are 3 roles, it is different forms at different times

Voltron: Tri-theism because although there are 5 parts working for the same goal, they are completely separate.

Egg: Tri-theism three parts combined, but they are of different essence.




Ontological and Economic Trinity

Ontological: Ontology is the study of being. The ontological structure is father, son, and Holy Spirit

Economic Trinity: The role of each person of the Trinity
Objections to the Doctrine:


Paradox: Something that seems contradictory, but with further scrutiny, the tension is resolved

Mystery: Something that is beyond our capacity to understand

Contradictions: Something said that may seem deep, but is completely nonsensical. 


Definition of Trinity: The choice to abandon the widely accepted teachings on an essential doctrine for one’s own view, to preach another gospel

The Trinity (statements)

God is one, there is one God
The Father is God
The Son is God
The Holy Spirit is God
The Father is not the Son
The Son is not the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is not the Father

Definition: Within the one being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit  - James White
