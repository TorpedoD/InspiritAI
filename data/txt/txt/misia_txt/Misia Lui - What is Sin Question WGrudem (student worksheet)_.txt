Systematic Theology, An introduction to Biblical Doctrine of Sin - Wayne Grudem 

 What is Sin? 

Any failure to conform to any moral law of God in act, attitude, or nature.
           	
One example is given for sin from the 10 commandments (Exodus 24.17). What does it mean to covet ?  

Covet means the desire to steal something from someone else.

Where did sin come from?  

All sin is ultimately irrational, meaning it was the moral creatures like the angels and humans who voluntarily sin, in which God predicted. 

Sin is like doing wrong is like a joke to a fool, But with wisdom is a pleasure to amount of understanding. A fool just thinks it’s funny, doesn't realize the seriousness and the stupidity of what he is doing.  Prov 10.23

Did Adam’s sin have consequences for us?  What are two results of inheriting sin? 

We inherit guilt
Inherited corruption


      6a. In ourselves we totally lack spiritual good and are totally unable to do spiritual good.
      6b. Are there degrees of sin? What is the example given? 

Legal guilts, even one sin makes us sinners, which is what Adam and Eve found out after eating the fruit. Results in the world, some sins are worse than others, it could be more destructive as well. It's wrong to covet a neighbour's car, but it's more wrong to steal the car when the desire to sin actually comes forth and you sin.

7. What happens when a Christian sins?   (two things)  Rom 8.1, Eph 4.30, Heb 12.6

Our legal standing before God is unchanged
Fellowship with God is disrupted and our Christian life is damaged

8. What kind of harm comes when we sin in our heart or with our bodies?  1 Peter 2.11

There is spiritual harm.
