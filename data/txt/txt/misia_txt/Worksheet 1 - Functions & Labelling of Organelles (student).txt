Chapter 1.1 & 1.2A - Studying the Structure of Cells & DNA  
HW: Read Textbook Pages 10-19, answer questions at end of handout 
Learning Goals: We will be…  
• Learning about the cell theory and what makes cells so unique and important  • Analyzing the main differences between plant and animal cells 
Success Criteria: We will be able to…  
• Identify the three main findings of the cell theory and explain why they are significant  • Explain the differences between a eukaryote and prokaryote  
• Visually identify and describe the differences between plant and animal cells  • Label and describe the function of several plant and animal cell organelles 
The Cell Theory  
1. All living things are made up of one or more cells and their products are made up of one or more cells and their products  
2. The cell is the simplest unit that can carry out all life processes  
3. All cells come from other cells, they do not come from non-living matter  
• All living things are made up of cells, but some very simple and some  very complex 
The Two Categories of Cells  
Prokaryote: always single celled organisms that do not contain a nucleus or  other membrane-bound organelles (e.g .E. Coli)  
Eukaryote: a cell that contains a nucleus and other organelles, each  surrounded by a thin membrane  
• Includes all protists, fungi, animals, and plants  
•Both contain genetic information.
