Description:
Imagine that you are working part-time and going to school (college or university).   You own everything in your room, and nothing else.   So if you want a couch, a table, or anything else that isn’t in your room, you’ll have to figure out what it costs and how you will pay for it.   You’ve only got so much money to spend in a month, and you need to take care of your basic needs, as well as have a little fun.  Build a budget of your monthly expenses and make a plan for what you will do with any extra income you have.

Instructions:

You need to try to earn more or the same amount as you spend over the 10 months you are at school.

Your tax bracket is 20% (you pay 20% of what you make in taxes)
You have a student loan that has covered your tuition, and leaves you with $250 for living expenses each month
