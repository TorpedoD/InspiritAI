Chubby Bunny Challenge 
Verbal intelligence

Teams: 



Game explanation: 

Each team will choose one representative to stuff their mouth with three marshmallows. Assorted flashcards with sentences/phrases (easy and hard) will then be distributed to each team for the representative with the mouth full of marshmallows to recite out to their fellow team members. The first team to guess the most phrases under the limited time will win the round. 

The sentences will be sorted out by difficulty: easy, medium, hard, and insane.
Depending on how many sentences guessed, the amount of points will be given according to the difficulty of the flashcards. Teams will only get 2 skips if they can not complete the phrase. Marshmallows must not leave the mouth, if so then that team would be disqualified for the round.
