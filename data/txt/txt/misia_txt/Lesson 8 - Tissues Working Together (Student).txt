Photosynthesis is performed by chlorophyll molecules embedded in the thylakoid membranes  of the chloroplasts in the cells of leaves. Leaves are efficient at absorbing light due to their thin, wide structure. 
Light energy + carbon dioxide + water = glucose + oxygen 
Glucose is transported and stored as other carbohydrates, such as starch. Plants  use these carbohydrates for cellular respiration. 
Stomata: Opening in leaf surface that allows gas exchange. Open and close to allow  carbon dioxide in and oxygen out.  
Guard cells: Pair of cells on surface to control stomata opening and closing. Open  and close stomata to ensure proper gas exchange and reduce water loss. 
Water is moved to the leaves from the roots via the xylem.
