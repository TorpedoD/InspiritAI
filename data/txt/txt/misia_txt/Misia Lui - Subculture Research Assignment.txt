Through this website, as online research, gacha games are extremely popular in this generation and contribute largely to all games in general. As well as through personal participant observation, gacha games are described as follows: 

Gacha games, or "gachapon" games, are a subculture within the gaming community that revolves around mobile games that feature the possibility system and gambling-like mechanics. These games typically involve collecting and upgrading characters or items through a randomized system, where players spend in-game currency or real money to obtain random rewards. The term "gacha" is from the Japanese word "gachapon," which refers to capsule toy vending machines that dispense random toys or collectibles.

History
The origins of gacha games can be traced back to Japan, where the concept of "gachapon” vending machines has been popular since the 1960s. The first gacha game is recorded to be "Insaniquarium," released in 1997 by Flying Bear Entertainment. However, this subculture gained significant traction with the release of mobile games like "Puzzle & Dragons" in 2012 and "Ensemble stars" in 2015, launched the concept of gacha games to not just japan, but the attraction of more of the world. There is no evidence that suggests that gacha games were created as a form of rebellion against any particular entity or concept. Rather, their development and popularity were driven by factors such as the addictive nature of randomized rewards, the appeal of character collecting and customization, the accessibility of mobile gaming, and most importantly the addictive nature of pulling for exclusive and rare in-game characters/materials.


While the core concept of randomized gacha systems has remained consistent, gacha games have evolved in several ways over time: early gacha games had relatively simple graphics and gameplay mechanics, but modern titles often feature high-quality visuals, intricate storylines, and complex character progression systems; due to concerns over the potential for gambling-like behavior and predatory monetization practices, some countries have implemented regulations or guidelines for gacha games, such as requiring disclosure of drop rates and limiting in-game purchases for minors; while initially focused on RPGs and puzzle games, gacha mechanics have been incorporated into various genres, including strategy, simulation, and even sports games; and many gacha games now feature "pity" systems, which guarantee players will receive a high-rarity item or character after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts, mitigating the frustration of repeated bad luck. This repeated cycle keeps the consumer reeled in to the spiral of constant farming for materials, and in many cases, and eventually lead to purchases with real money. 
Where to Look For…
Gacha games and their associated subculture can be found primarily in online communities and mobile gaming platforms. Popular examples include dedicated subreddits, Discord servers, and social media groups where players discuss strategies, share experiences, and engage in trading or gifting of in-game items. A lot of the time, conversation chat rooms regarding such topics may lead to toxicity and the overexploitation of characters sexually, or lore in general. 

Material Culture
The material culture associated with gacha games includes mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets used for playing the games, merchandise like figurines, keychains, and apparel featuring characters from popular gacha games, as well as physical gacha machines or capsule toy vending machines, which inspired the concept of randomized loot boxes in these games.


Nonmaterial Culture
The non-material culture of gacha games encompasses shared terminology and slang among players, such as "rerolling," "whaling," and "salt," as well as strategies and tactics for optimizing character and item acquisition and progression within the games. It also includes fan art, cosplay, and creative works inspired by gacha game characters and narratives. Additionally, online communities and forums serve as platforms where players interact, share information, and engage with the broader gacha game subculture.
