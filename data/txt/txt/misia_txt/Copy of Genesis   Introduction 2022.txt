The scripture memory tests will be in a “fill-in-the-blanks” format.  Although there are many good translations available, the translation that we will use is the English Standard Version.  For all Scripture Memory tests, each word will be worth 1 mark.  Incorrect spelling (including making plural words singular and singular words plural) will result in a deduction of 0.5 marks.  Incorrect punctuation will not be penalized.
