(ANSWER SHEET)
Basics 
What is Human Cloning?
Human cloning originates from the concept of gene cloning. This involves manipulating DNA in a genome in order to create a genetically identical copy of wherever the DNA initially had been produced. In this case, human cloning is the process of creating a genetically identical copy of a human.

How is This Process Created?

Two ways: 
Somatic Nuclear Transfer (SCNT)
Implanting of a donor nucleus to replace a nucleus in another individuals’ egg cell.

Embryo Cloning Through In Vitro Fertilization (IVF)
Creating a zygote from sperm and egg outside the female's body, that later form into identical cells and are implanted. 

List out arguments that each side of Human Cloning has been stated.
