Aristocracy 
The highest class in certain societies, especially those holding hereditary titles or offices. (i.e Duke, Duchess, Baron, Baroness, etc.)
They operate by letting each individual member make decisions, similar to social classes as well. 
Pros: 
Usually this form of government will choose people who are suitable for leadership and highly qualified.
Aristocratic members will probably not get swayed by public opinion and do what is best. 
Cons: 
Leaders like this aren’t accountable for their actions. 
They might use their power selfishly, by dividing power between society. 
 
An example of aristocracy would be the system in the UK. I would say that it was pretty successful as it has put a lot of order and respect towards the entire country. 

Oligarchy 
A  small group of people having control of a country, organization, or institution. 
They operate by choosing people who are of different economic statuses, prestige, languages, or religion etc., and each of those hereditary persons controls their only “class” 

Pros: 
Those who wield the most skills and expertise are given the most power 
Within oligarchy, the general public can do basically anything they want as long as it;s legal. 

Cons: 
Brings up income inequality.
Might disrupt the economy. 

An example of oligarchy would be China. Technically it has succeeded in taking order, but is it the right choice? Unsure.
