Read Pg 29 to 32, Answer Learning Check Pg 32 #1-4

Learning Goals: We will be… 
• Examining the importance of cell division in the survival of  different organisms.
Success Criteria: We will be able to… 
• Explain the importance of cell division based on its  three main purposes  
• Define types of active & passive diffusion and explain  their importance in cell division. 
What is Cell Division? 
• The process by which a  
________ cell gives rise to  
two __________ cells.  
• Involves the division of the  
__________ (nuclear  
division) and ____________ 
(division of the cytoplasm).

Why Do Cells Need To Divide?  
• IDEAS?  
• Cell division allows organisms to:  1. ___________  
2.______________  
3. ________
Reproduction 
• A) Asexual Reproduction  
• Parent cell division results in ________________ • Each new cell must (ideally) have a _________ set  of _______ 
• Involves only _____________ 
• Can either produce two equal cells (____________  cell division) or two unequal cells (_____________  cell division)  
• Asymmetrical division can lead to several issues.

Reproduction 
• Sexual reproduction  
•A cell from __________ joins  
with a cell from __________  
parent.  
•Gametes: these cells contain  
only half of the _______ 
usually found in a ______ cell.  
•When two gametes combine,  
the offspring inherits  
______________ from both  
parents.
Repair 
Every day, your body sheds _________ of dead skin  cells, replaced by new ones.  
•Your body replaces each red blood cell every  _________.  
•If you break a bone, cells divide to __________.  •As cells die, are damaged, wear out or are lost,  new cells must ____________. 
•All organisms need to repair themselves to  _____ ______.
Growth 
• One of the basic processes of all life is GROWTH. All  cells grow, but they eventually reach a __________…  
• We know that the larger the volume the greater number of  reactions that can occur.  
• All nutrients required for metabolism can only enter the  cell through its membrane (dependant on surface area).  
• As surface area increases, so does the cells’ ability to  transport materials through its membrane. 
Growth: Diffusion & Osmosis 
•Chemicals used by cells enter the cell across the  membrane by the process called ____________. ▪from area of ________ concentration to an area  of ____ concentration 
•________ enters and leaves cells by a process called  ____________. 
▪water always moves toward where the solution is  ______ concentrated 
•Diffusion and osmosis take _____. If a cell gets too  large, chemicals and water cannot move ___________.

Growth 
• Therefore, a cell with a certain volume needs  an appropriate surface area to match it.  
• As a cell grows the surface area to volume ratio  decreases.  
• At some point in cell growth this ______  becomes so small that its surface area is too  small to supply its raw materials to its volume.  
• The cell must either _____ or _____.  
• Therefore, as organisms grow the number of  cells in that organism must increase.
