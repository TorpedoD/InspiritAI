Describe the setting of the story. What kind of world does our main character live in? What setting changes occur as the story progresses? Explain how repurposed myths can use settings to relate to readers.

In the first few chapters of "Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief," the setting evolves from a contemporary boarding school in New York to a world where Greek mythology blends with modern reality. The story begins at Yancy Academy, then shifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where Percy encounters the first monster. The setting then moves to Camp Half-Blood, a sanctuary for demigods, for Percy’s protection before traveling into various locations with mythological significance, such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. By swirling familiar modern settings with elements of Greek mythology, author Rick Riordan creates a world that is both relatable and fantastical, which allows young readers to imagine mythological/magical adventures existing within their own everyday surroundings.

If I had dyslexia and ADHD, learning in class would be hard as I would have difficulty with reading comprehension and fluency, struggle with spelling and writing, a hard time with organization and time management, and trouble following instructions. In life, navigation and spatial awareness would also be a struggle, and I think a big area for me would be social anxiety and self-esteem . By having dyslexia, it's possible that creativity and skills at problem-solving would sprout from this; with ADHD I would probably be creative and think  more "outside the box", with an addition to  hyperfocusing on topics of interest. Some down sides to this are that reading and writing tasks would take much longer to complete, resulting in prolonged frustration, and I can be easily distracted and forgetful. 

What does Percy learn about the Greek Gods when he gets to Camp Half-Blood? What is his reaction?

When Percy Jackson arrives at Camp Half-Blood, he learns that Greek gods are real, including the fact that he is the son of Poseidon. Percy’s reaction displays skepticism, frustration, and being overwhelmed by this new reality. 

What appears to be the main problem in this story? What are some other problems that need to be resolved?

The central conflict of the story is the theft of Zeus's master lightning bolt. Percy is accused of stealing it, and he must embark on a quest to find and return the bolt to prevent a war among the gods. Alongside this central conflict, Percy faces several other issues: he goes through an identity crisis  as a demigod and learns to harness his powers, while simultaneously seeking  to rescue his mother who has disappeared to the underworld, as well as uncovering the true thief behind the bolt's disappearance. Additionally, he must build relationships with his companions, Annabeth and Grover.

What feelings does Percy have about his quest to the Underworld? What does this tell us about Percy’s character? 

Percy's feelings about his quest to the Underworld are a mix of determination, anxiety, and uncertainty. He is driven by a strong desire to save his mother and prevent a war among the gods, showcasing his loyalty and love towards his mother and a strong sense of duty. However, Percy is also unsure of his abilities as a newly discovered demigod (He is still understanding who he is). These conflicting emotions tell us that Percy is a complex character with courage and a strong moral compass, yet still relatable to normal children due to his self-doubt and fears. 


What challenges and trials has Percy had to face up to this point? How has each affected Percy and the other characters?

Some challenges Percy faces that shape his character and the story  his monster encounter with Mrs. Dodds, the Minotaur attack where he loses his mother, adapting to life at Camp Half-Blood, being claimed by Poseidon, accepting the quest to retrieve Zeus's master bolt, receiving a cryptic prophecy, as well as embarking on his journey with Annabeth and Grover. Each trial forces Percy to confront his demigod identity, develop his abilities, and take on increasing responsibilities all while only being an awkward 12 year old boy. These challenges also impact other characters, such the deepening friendships with Grover and Annabeth, and guidance of Camp Half-Blood's leaders. Through each trial, it pushes Percy to begin his transformation from an ordinary troubled kid to a hero/demigod-in-training.
