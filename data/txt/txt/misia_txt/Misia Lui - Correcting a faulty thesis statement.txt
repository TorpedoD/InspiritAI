Errors to avoid when composing a thesis


1. A thesis cannot be a fragment; it must be expressed in a sentence.

Poor: How driving in winter can be dangerous.

Better: During the winter, driving can be very dangerous due to the amount of snow on the road. 

2. A thesis must not be in the form of a question. (Usually the answer to that question 
    could be the thesis).

Poor: Should eighteen year olds have the right to vote?

Better: Eighteen years olds should have access to a right to vote. 

3. A thesis must not contain phrases as I think. (They merely weaken the statement)
Poor: I think forest fires are the biggest danger facing our natural resources.
Better: Forest fires have big potential to be a danger facing our natural resources. 

4. A thesis must not contain elements that are not clearly related.
Poor: All novelists seek the truth; therefore some novelists are good psychologists.
Better: Psychologists and novelists are similar, because they both seek the truth.

5. A thesis must not be expressed in vague language.
Poor: Power and privilege affect an individual’s maturity.
Better: If a human possesses both power and privilege, it can majorly affect their maturity level and human decency. 

6. A thesis must not be expressed in muddled or incoherent language.
Poor: All students should not think that university is for everyone, because for many people they 
         have a career that high school was all they needed. 

Better: Students shouldn’t have the mindset that university is the only solution to a successful life, because for many people, graduating highschool was more than enough to succeed. 

7. A thesis should not be written in figurative language.

Poor: Love is the rose in the garden of our existence.

Better: Love in our lives can be represented like a single rose in a garden.
