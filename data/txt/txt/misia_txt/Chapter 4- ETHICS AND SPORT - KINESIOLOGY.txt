Male and female athletes today have many opportunities to experience success. How their women still face  disadvantages when it comes to level of participation, financial compensation, and endorsement deals.  Do some research and then complete the chart below to show the differences in financial compensation in six  sports, leagues and events for pro male athletes versus pro female athletes.  


After completing your research, answer questions below. For each question, state your opinion or make  suggestions, and then provide a rationale.  
● Do you think that pay equity for male and female athletes is good for sports in general? Why or why not?
If it were just to view a gender aspect, then no, equity is not good for sports in general. Men get paid much more than women and the treatment is insanely unfair. If you were to view equity of pay in an overall sense, then yes, the equity is good. This is because it is not based on gender discrimination, it is just based on the fact mens’ sports have a higher viewing count and popularity. The more views and fans, the more sponsorships and annual pay. 
● Should the media bear some responsibility to promote pay equity for men and women in professional-level  sport?  
Yes. 
● What measures might (a) the Canadian federal government and (b) private corporation take to promote  gender based pay equity in Canadian sport? 
Class Discussion:  
Would pay equity have a positive overall impact on gender equality in a sport? Might pay equity in the world of  sport have a positive influence on gender equality in society as a whole? Explain your thinking.  
There has been a lot of attention regarding transgenderism in sport, specifically transgender women competing in  women’s competition. In your opinion, should this be allowed? Should there be boundaries/divisions? If so, what  criteria should be used? 
THE ETHICS OF SPORT ADVERTISING  
Issue one: should alcohol manufacturers be prohibited from sponsoring athletes and sports events?  
Scenario: For years, large companies all around the world have capitalized on the mass public appeal of sports in  marketing, a white array of products and services. Cigarettes, alcohol, breakfast cereal, soft drinks, candy, snacks,  and even ”junk food” have all been endorsed by sponsors of sporting events, and by high-profile athletes. These  
athletes receive huge financial rewards for endorsing a variety of products. However, many of these products may  actually be harmful to human health. As a case in point, In Canada cigarette companies used to sponsor tennis  tournaments and curling bonspiels, despite the obvious “disconnect” between smoking cigarettes and playing the  sports. In 2000, however, Canadian federal laws were passed that restricted that advertisement of cigarettes at  sporting events.  
Should the Canadian government ban alcohol manufacturers from sponsoring athletes and sporting events, in the  spaces provided below summarize arguments for and against such a ban, and then especially your own viewpoint on  the issue in a well-organized paragraph.  
Arguments for:  
Arguments against: 
Your viewpoint on the issue:  
Issue two: should celebrity athletes endorse only healthy food products in advertising campaigns? Scenario: in 2013, the journal Pediatrics published the results of an eye-opening study that found that 79% of 62  food products endorsed athletes in TV, radio, and Internet advertisements were calorie, dense and nutrient-poor.  About 93% of the 46 beverages advertised derived 100% of their calories from sugar! The researchers had evaluated  the nutritional quality of products endorsed by celebrities including:  
-NHL player, Sidney Crosby, (Gatorade, and Tim Hortons)  
-NBA basketball superstar, LeBron James (McDonald’s and Sprite)  
-NFL player Peyton Manning (Gatorade and Pepsi cola)  
-Tennis player Serena Williams (Kraft Oreo cookies and Gatorade) 
The study’s authors proclaimed, “The promotion of energy-dense, nutrient-poor products by some of the world’s  most physically fit, and well-known athletes is an ironic combination that sends mixed messages about diet and  health.” The authors also declared that, “Professional athletes have an important opportunity to promote public  health, particularly for youth, by refusing endorsement contracts” (Promoting junk food).  
The authors urge governments worldwide to draw upon policies that restrict advertisements of unhealthy food and  beverage products featuring professional athletes in media targeted at youth.  
Complete the steps below to develop your thinking with regards to the issue of athlete’s endorsements of unhealthy  food products in the world of sport.  
1. Find and briefly describe an example of a TV (find the commercial on YouTube) advertisement in which an  athlete endorses a product that will clearly not benefit the health and well-being of that athlete or the  general public. Include the link to the video and be prepared to share the commercial with the class.

2. Explain why there’s an obvious disconnect between the product, and the athlete, who is endorsing the  product.  
______________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________  
3. Decide whether legislation should be passed banning the endorsement of unhealthy food products by  celebrity athletes. Justify your decision as persuasively as you can.

TRUE SPORT – WHAT CONSTITUTES “FAIR PLAY?”  
Understanding the origin of the True Sport Movement can further your appreciation of current trends and  events related to ethical conduct in sport, and how “Fair Play” principles apply in everyday situations. 
Championing “Fair Play “in sport in Canada 
The concept of “Fair Play” is important not only in sporting situations, but in society as a whole. With this in mind,  federal and provincial government leaders from across Canada met in 2001 to discuss some controversial issues  that had arisen in sport.  
These leaders recognized the positive impact that “Fair Play” practices in sport can have in our communities, and  they sought to find a way to reduce the incidence of violent, bullying, cheating, aggressive, parental behavior, and  doping in relation to sport.  
Their discussions led to the signalling of the London declaration in 2001. This declaration was described as “an  unprecedented” affirmation of positive sporting values and principles. The Canadian centre for ethics in sport  (CCES) then led a series of discussions across Canada to identify how to help young athletes stay on an ethical  path in the early 2000s the CCES helped to form True sport. 
True Sport is a series of programs and initiatives that are centred on sports values and principles: fairness,  excellence, inclusion, and fun. Schools, communities, and organizations can tap into these programs and initiatives  to help promote the many positive benefits that play in sport can provide.  
True Sport believes that good sport can make a profound difference in our athletes and in our communities and thus  they promote the following seven true sport principles.  
The seven true sport principles  
1. Keep it fun. Find the joy of sport and have a good time. Look to make a positive difference, on the  field, and in your community.  
2. Respect others. Show respect for everyone in creating a sports experience, both on the field and off  with dignity and grace.  
3. Give back. Always remember the community that supports your support and help make it possible.  Find ways to show your appreciation and help others get the most out of sport.  
4. Go for it. Always strive for excellence and rise to the challenge, but never at the expense of others.  Discover how good you can be.  
5. Play fair. Play honestly and obey the rules in letter and in spirit. Winning is only meaningful when the  competition is fair.  
6. Stay healthy. Place physical and mental health above all other considerations and avoid unsafe  activities. Respect your body and keep in shape.  
7. Including everyone. Share sports with others, regardless of creed, ethnicity, gender, sexual  orientation, or ability. Invite everyone into sport and make it more meaningful for the whole  community.  
Apply the seven through sport principles to help you evaluate and respond to the dilemmas outlined  in the scenarios below. Identify the specific true sport principle that pertains to each scenario. 
Scenario 1: You are helping out as a leader with a house league hockey team. The team is made up  of boys and girls who are seven years old. You notice that the coach only chooses a few of the more  talented boys to demonstrate skills. Explain how you would react to the coach’s behavior, and why.

Scenario 2: Your school's dance team has worked extremely hard over the past three years. The  team members have developed outstanding skills and abilities. As a result, they have won all the  competitions they entered in the past year. If you were the coach, what more could you do to  challenge your team?  
______________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________________  
Scenario 3: You are a member of your school's football team. Two students from your school have the  job of holding the first down measuring chain (which marks the distance to the first down). During a  league game, you notice the students who are holding the measuring chain and moving the flag too  far, that’s giving your team an unfair advantage when you are on . Explain how you would react to the  situation and why.

Scenario 4: You are a pitcher for a Rep softball team. You are enjoying an excellent game, pitching a  no-hitter as you head towards the final inning. There are two outs, and the potential last batter is at  the plate. The batter connects with your pitch and springs to first base. It appears the runners are just  barely thrown out at first, when the umpire calls her safe. Explain how you would react to the umpires  called and why.
