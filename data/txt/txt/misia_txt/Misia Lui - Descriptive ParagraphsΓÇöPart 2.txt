PICTURE #2: Street Meat 

Six hotdogs 
Sitting on a bench 
Close up picture of food 
Smell of freshly sizzles sausages 
Most prominent hotdog is drizzles with barbeque sauce, mustard, and ketchup
Feel the sauce seeping into the bun
Ready to take a bite 
Bustling downtown atmosphere
Surrounding voices blending together 
Hot summer weather 
Body heat and hot meat amplifying the area 
Summer shorts, flip flops 
Ice cold drinks somewhere 
Thoughts of sipping amidst the weather 

Summer. The season of heat; the season of no school. A time of relaxation; a time of joy. 
Within the heart of downtown is a group of six on a weathered wooden bench, holding delectable hotdogs resting enticingly in their glossy deliciousness glistening in the heat. The air is thick with the mouthwatering essence of freshly sizzling sausages, each breath infused with the promise of true summer indulgence. One hotdog, a masterpiece drizzled with rich barbecue sauce, vibrant mustard, and tangy ketchup, beckons with its vibrant colors. Another hotdog, with ketchup and mustard intertwined together in a beautiful marriage. Three other hotdogs – each draped in a luscious cascade of vibrant ketchup; they share an unbreakable bond as if they were siblings emerging from the same beloved bottle, despite resting in their distinct buns. The last stands alone; unseasoned, untouched, fresh off the grill, ordinary. Perhaps most look too much at the sauces, but at the end of the day a hotdog is a hotdog; that’s what makes it unique enough. As the sauce seeps into the soft bun, one can almost feel the warmth radiating from the meat, inviting a hungry will to take that first, savory bite. Surrounding voices blend into a lively symphony of laughter and chatter, punctuated by the occasional shake of ice cold drinks pouring nearby. The bustling atmosphere is alive with energy; summer shorts and flip-flops thrive as people stroll by, their bodies warmed by the sun and the enticing aroma of the street meat. Thoughts drift toward refreshing sips of chilled beverages that promise to quench the thirst stirred by both the heat and the delicious anticipation of street food delights.








PICTURE #4: Campfire 

Flaming fire 
Blowing towards the top right 
Bold lemon yellow glowing with sunset orange 
Sunset orange projecting to the inner sides
Circular rock formation ash grey 
Firewood burning 
Marshmallow skewers peeking out in the bottom left edges 
Sounds of sizzling, like rapid keyboard clacking 
Frustrated fire wanting to escape 
Cold weather, somewhere within fall
Time of day is dusk, waiting for the black night
Smell of burning firewood 
Radiating marshmallow scent 


As dusk settles over the silent landscape, a flaming fire crackles energetically within a circular formation of ash-grey rocks, its bold lemon yellow flames glowing vibrantly with sunset orange hues. The wind gently guides the eager flames as they dance to the right, swirling and fluttering in a mesmerizing display that seems to respond gracefully to its invisible touch. The warm light projects an inviting glow onto the inner sides of the stone circle, casting flickering shadows that play across the cool ground. The air is filled with the rich, earthy scent of burning firewood, mingling with the sweet aroma of marshmallows roasting on skewers that peek out from the bottom left edges of the scene. The sounds of sizzling echo like rapid keyboard clacking, as if the frustrated fire yearns to escape its confines, reaching upward in a spirited display. As the chill of fall settles in, anticipation hangs in the air, waiting for the encroaching black night to envelop the world around this cozy gathering.
















PICTURE #8: Dead Man’s Island 

Camp Mini-yo-we
Clearest blue sky 
Like tinted glass faded with frost at the bottom 
Sand under your toes
4 dark red canoes
Sound of them ever so slightly rocking form the shore hitting 
Glistening waves of the lake 
Calling out for you to touch its beautiful jewels
Look beyond the shore to see the waters gradually deepen 
Wanting for you to discover its mysteries 
Island just beyond the coast, guarded by tall evergreen trees, as if holding spears 
There must be history/ secrets there 
Smell of sea salt 
Sound of seagulls landing on canoes
Bright fresh breeze 

Just beyond the shore of Camp Mini-yo-we, Dead Man's Island floats enigmatically, a mysterious sentinel guarded by tall evergreen trees standing like ancient warriors with spears raised to the sky. The island beckons from across the glistening waves of the lake, its secrets hidden behind the verdant curtain of foliage. The clearest blue sky stretches overhead, resembling tinted glass that fades to a frosted hue at the horizon. On the beach, fine sand nestles between your toes as you gaze out at the tranquil scene. Four dark red canoes rest at the water's edge, their hulls gently rocking with each lapping wave. The rhythmic sound of water against wood mingles with the cries of seagulls alighting on the canoes, creating a soothing maritime melody. The lake's surface sparkles like a tapestry of jewels, inviting exploration of its gradually deepening waters and the mysteries that lie beneath. A bright, fresh breeze carries the invigorating scent of sea salt and damp earth, mingling with the faint aroma of pine from the towering trees nearby. As you breathe in deeply, you can almost taste the crispness of the air, filled with anticipation and adventure that lie within the land beyond. As you stand on the shore, the island seems to call out, its history and secrets waiting to be discovered by those brave enough to venture across the shimmering expanse.
