GENESIS 1-2 God and his Creation 

Many debates surround how to interpret Genesis 1 in Christian circles.  The creation account is also debated in relation with contemporary science.  I want to suggest key points that all Christians can agree on that make sense of creation and the rest of the Bible. These points are a summary of Christian apologists, Francis Shaeffer and D.A. Carson. 

2. God made everything that is non god 

There is a distinction between creator and creature. He make all things from nothing. He spoke and it came to be. This means everything in the universe is dependent on god. 

3. There is only one of him 

Yet a hint of complexity to his oneness is gen 1:26, “let us make man in our image.” We bear God's image.

4. God is a talking God 

God is a person who discloses himself in words we can understand. 

5. Everything God makes is good-very good 

Gen 1-2 all things are perfect. Good is the summary of each act of creation. 

6. God comes to an end of his created work 

He finishes his creative work in six days. Designates the seventh day as special 

7. The creation proclaims his greatness glory 

The more you know about the created order, the more our response ought to be adoration and awer . Ps 19:1-4 “The heavens declare the glory of god, the skies proclaim the work out of your heart. 

























Much more could be stated and addressed in Genesis 1. But these points provide a foundation to understand the rest of the Bible.  This account is the beginning of history.  It provides us with a framework for our origin, gives us meaning and purpose, and moves us toward our destiny. We will explore what it means to be human, how things go so wrong, and look briefly at the relationship between science and the Bible.
