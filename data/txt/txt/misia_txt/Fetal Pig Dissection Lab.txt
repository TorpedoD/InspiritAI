Introduction

This lab involves dissecting a fetal pig to study the structure and organization of various body systems in an animal; specifically for gr11 biology, the fetal pig. The fetal pig serves as a suitable substitute for learning about human anatomy due to the similarities between the two. A fetal pig is an unborn pig that has developed sufficiently for its organs to have formed, therefore eligible for a dissection analysis. Through this dissection, which involves carefully opening up the body, others can examine and analyze the internal structures and organ systems. Specifically, this dissection allows for the observation and understanding of the respiratory, digestive, and circulatory systems. By exploring the anatomy of the fetal pig, others will gain insights into the organization and functioning of these critical life systems in a hands-on and practical manner.

Newspaper
Fetal Pig








Methods
(Refer to Nelson Biology 11 textbook, pg. 506 (Galbraith, 2001))
All procedures that were included in the textbook were followed as precisely as possible. No mistakes were made.
The only slight change in methods was an additional decision to go through the head of the pig fetus and into its skull. This was done in order to extract the brain. The procedure went smoothly where it was needed to cut through the top skins with a scalpel and tweezers, but when cutting through the skull, the scalpel accidentally went in too deep, and when pulled out caused the inner brain to damage. By prying open the skull a little bit more, further investigation confirmed that the brain had been damaged by the scalpel and was no longer liable for a proper extraction. 

Safety Considerations:

Before the Experiment
Before the dissection on both days (as this was a two day dissection), the researchers are required to dress in a  clear plastic lab apron to prevent chemicals and other foreign bodily fluids from tainting underlying clothing, and put on rubber gloves in order to protect the hands from touching anything. Goggles were used to protect the eyes to prevent any foreseeable chemicals or fluids from direct contact with the eyes, and given an option of a mask to prevent inhaling of chemicals and foul and possibly harmful smells. Lastly, experimenters who had longer hair were required to tie up their hair to avoid direct contact with the dissection subject. 

During the Experiment
Immediately when the experiment starts, all examiners are to use the required tools in order to conduct the dissection. Tools such as T-pins used to pin down the fetal pig’s arms and legs to the tray were used delicately without the intention of any injuries. A scalpel, scissors, and tweezers were all provided to assist in the main incisions, and were used with carefulness and were faced away from the examiners’ faces to avoid personal harm. No rough or active actions were prohibited during this lab, or running around to prevent disturbance and/or messy scattering. To definitely make sure that the examiners’ safety was ensured, no food was allowed to be consumed or touched during the procedure, and gloves were to not be taken off aside from when taking notes in order to ensure anyone will not rub their eyes or directly touch their face. 

After the Experiment
In the course of completion of the dissection on the first day, the tray containing the  already dissected fetal pig was carefully sealed within a plastic bag. This was done in order to safely preserve the fetal body until the next day. On the following  second day, after the procedure had concluded, the fetal pig remains were appropriately discarded into a  designated garbage bag, along with the other dissected fetal pigs from other experimenters. Thorough cleaning and sanitization of the tools and equipment were carried out afterwards. All instruments were to be thoroughly rinsed with soap and water, ensuring the removal of any toxic or unsanitary residual substances, before being laid out to air dry. Following the initial safety protocols, the disposable rubber gloves and plastic aprons worn during the dissection were properly discarded after each day's dissection. The protective goggles were carefully stored away for future use. Finally, a comprehensive cleaning of the work area was undertaken, ensuring that no remnants of the dissected specimens or harmful bodily fluids were left behind, maintaining a clean and hygienic environment.

Discussion/Analysis
Distinct differences exist between the mouth structures of fetal pigs and humans. Firstly, fetal pigs possess an elongated and narrow mouth compared to the human mouth. This adaptation is likely the case due to the food consumption of the fetus without obstructing the eyes or nose, as pigs lack the ability to use hands for eating. Secondly, the fetal pig's teeth were barely visible during the dissection procedure and only felt if you pressed on the inside of the pig’s gums. This might’ve been the case due to their short lifespan before dying, which may not have been enough time for the teeth to finally grow in. A final note to acknowledge was that the fetal pig's tongue exhibited a darker, slimmer, and more stretched out form than the human tongue. While the crooked shape could have resulted from chemical preservation, the length corresponds to the extended skull and facial structure of the fetal pig. 
The digestive process in fetal pigs closely parallels humans over some variables. Upon food entering the mouth, saliva and oral enzymes break down and initiate food particles, as well as the actions of grinding teeth. The tongue then moves the food into the esophagus, which transports it to the stomach immediately after. Here, muscular contractions and gastric juices further digest the food. Following this, the partially digested food enters the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. The remaining material proceeds to the large intestine, where residual nutrients are extracted, and feces/waste (aka poo) is formed. The feces accumulate in the rectum until eventual excretion through the anus. Although very differently operated systems, the respiratory and circulatory systems are somewhat interconnected in various ways. One of the most crucial relations is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During inhalation, oxygen enters the lungs (respiratory system) and diffuses into the bloodstream. The blood circulates through the heart and body, collecting waste products and carbon dioxide along the way. This continuous gas exchange is vital for sustaining the body of both humans and fetal pigs. Another pair of interconnected systems is the digestive and circulatory systems. One significant link between these systems is the transfer and removal of waste products. The circulatory system transports waste throughout the body to the digestive system, facilitating its eventual “ejection” through the digestive tract.



Conclusion
This direct dissection lab provided an invaluable opportunity to witness the complex workings of biological systems and their role in sustaining life. It offered an insightful understanding of anatomy and an indirect process of conception to a fetus development. By bridging prior knowledge and practical application through dissecting the fetus’ organisms, the lab significantly enhanced the knowledge of complex living processes. This immersive experience highlighted similarities and differences between human and fetal pig organ systems while being able to appreciate the miracles of life and shared biological processes. Everything God has made in this world has its own systems, though similar and extremely complex, they all work together and fit together perfectly like a puzzle. This dissection influenced a deeper appreciation for the intricate design, functionality, and seamless coordination of organ systems that enable the life that we and every other living being have. Moreover, witnessing the developmental journey from embryonic growth to fully formed organisms instilled an appreciation for the intricate processes of bodily anatomy, and the wonder and amazement of how anything and everything that seems too complicated, are all connected in the system of fueling life itself. Ultimately, this lab goes beyond just academics and experimenting, but cultivating a deeper understanding and appreciation for the biological marvels around us, updating the knowledge of an overall perspective of life.
