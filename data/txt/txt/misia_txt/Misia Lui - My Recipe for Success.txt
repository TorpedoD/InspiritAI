Living with the End in Mind…

Only One Life
By C.T. Studd


Two little lines I heard one day,
Traveling along life’s busy way;
Bringing conviction to my heart,
And from my mind would not depart;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past, 
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Only one life, yes only one,
Soon will its fleeting hours be done;
Then, in ‘that day’ my Lord to meet,
And stand before His Judgement seat;
Only one life,’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Only one life, the still small voice,
Gently pleads for a better choice
Bidding me selfish aims to leave,
And to God’s holy will to cleave;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Only one life, a few brief years,
Each with its burdens, hopes, and fears;
Each with its clays I must fulfill,
living for self or in His will;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 

When this bright world would tempt me sore,
When Satan would a victory score;
When self would seek to have its way,
Then help me Lord with joy to say;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Give me Father, a purpose deep,
In joy or sorrow Thy word to keep;
Faithful and true what e’er the strife,
Pleasing Thee in my daily life;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Oh let my love with fervor burn,
And from the world now let me turn;
Living for Thee, and Thee alone,
Bringing Thee pleasure on Thy throne;
Only one life, ’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.
 
Only one life, yes only one,
Now let me say,”Thy will be done”;
And when at last I’ll hear the call,
I know I’ll say “twas worth it all”;
Only one life,’twill soon be past,
Only what’s done for Christ will last.


How do I want people to remember me one day?  What virtues or Christian qualities do I hope I have shown in my life?

Are there some things I need to leave behind in order to run the race of Christian discipleship?
Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal… Phil 3:13,14


Is there a verse from Paul’s letters that stands out to me and that I can turn into a prayer as I seek to move forward in my Christian life?  Here is an example below:

Dear Lord,
I pray that whatever was to my profit, I would now consider loss for the sake of Christ.  I pray that I would consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord…I thank you for the righteousness that is not my own, but that comes from God and is by faith.  I want to know you, Christ, and the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in your sufferings…and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead. 
Lord, I pray that my life would be defined by two great things – your death on the cross on my behalf and the resurrection life that awaits.  May your sacrifice for me allow me to live with deep grace and humility towards others, and may the hope of eternal life give me joy and courage to live boldly and self-sacrificially  (Prayer based on Phil 3:7-11).
