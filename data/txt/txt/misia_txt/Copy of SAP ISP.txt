Abstract:

	Growing worries, about safety in schools across America have led Canadians to rethink their options for education. This research delves into the perspectives of youths regarding the safety of colleges and how it influences their decision making processes. An examination of survey findings indicates that while some students are enticed by the quality of programs and job prospects at US universities, a significant number are deterred by concerns about safety. These apprehensions revolve around issues such as gun violence, discrimination and overall campus security when compared to Canada. The data suggests a link between safety worries and the choice not to apply to institutions, with students giving priority to factors like expenses, proximity to family and educational opportunities. Although some participants mentioned evolving viewpoints over time, safety considerations continue to play a role in shaping the secondary paths of Canadian youth. This study contributes insights into the factors influencing students educational choices and highlights the significance of addressing safety perceptions in international higher education settings.

Introduction:

In recent times, the education scene in the United States has been plagued by a concerning trend; the growing occurrence of school shootings. Data from an analysis covering the period from the 1997–1998 school year to the 2021–2022 school year reveals a total of 1,149 incidents of school shootings in the United States (Katsiyannis et al., 2022). This pattern has sparked worries not only within America but also among neighbouring nations like Canada. Particularly Canadian high school students are increasingly pondering how these violent occurrences might impact their decisions regarding secondary education. This study aims to delve into the viewpoints and choices of youth regarding universities amidst the escalating threat of school violence.

The context in which this research is set unfolds against a backdrop dominated by the realities of school shootings. From the 2009–2010 school year to the 2018–2019 school year, there were 318 instances of school shootings at K–12 schools in America. Disturbingly, these incidents have been on a trajectory, with 2023 witnessing six times more school shootings, than previous years. The characteristics of these school shootings show a mix of factors, with half of the incidents carried out by former students. While wealthier suburban and rural schools were urban, impoverished schools faced higher overall incidents, often driven by disputes involving non students or unidentified individuals (K-12 education, 2020). Furthermore, the impacts of these events go beyond the school grounds, affecting the community and raising concerns, about safety and well being.

At the heart of the investigation is the theory that the rise in both the frequency and visibility of school shootings in the United States could significantly shape how Canadian students perceive risks and decide on their secondary education. Past studies have shown that school shootings not only lead to enrollment drops but also have effects on academic performance and the overall school atmosphere. Families might choose to move their children to what they see as environments, resulting in reduced enrollment levels in 9th grade (Ordway, 2023). Moreover, the trauma and anxiety from these incidents can hinder progress, leading to scores on standardized tests and long term mental distress (Luke et al., 2024).

In the midst of these circumstances, Canadian youth are navigating their choices for post-secondary education. This report intends to illuminate their viewpoints, worries and factors influencing their decisions regarding colleges, given the issue of school violence. Through exploring how they perceive safety and their educational goals intersect, the aim is to offer perspectives that can guide strategies, assistance programs and actions to safeguard the welfare and academic prospects of youth.

Methods: 

This research study used a detailed survey method to investigate the education preferences of Canadians in light of the rising violence in the United States. The survey was shared online with a group that included high school students in grades 11 and 12 as well as current university students. Participants were recruited through channels like the media, PCA students, and other school districts. A total of 32 students took part in the survey, offering insights into their thoughts and decision making processes.

The survey questions were carefully crafted to gauge how students view the safety and attractiveness of universities. These questions covered aspects, such as their likelihood of applying to U.S. Schools reasons for applying and concerns about costs and campus safety worries about being from family if they choose an American university and the chances of attending if accepted. Responses were rated on a scale from 1 to 10, where higher scores indicated inclinations or increased levels of concern. The survey also included ended questions to gather insights into how students perceive and think about these issues.

The main goal of the survey was to collect data, on what influences high school students decisions about postsecondary education, especially when it comes to American universities. The survey aimed to explore how concerns about safety on U.S. campuses impacted student choices and whether these concerns made American universities less appealing, as study options despite other advantages they may offer.

Results:

The results of a survey conducted among high school students, in Canada revealed some insights into their preferences and worries when it comes to pursuing higher education particularly in the United States. The survey included students from grades from grades 11 and 12 aged between 16 to 18 years. The gender distribution among the participants was even providing a rounded view of concerns across various demographic groups. One significant discovery from the survey was that 60% of students were hesitant about applying to universities due to concerns about campus safety. Among these students 40% cited safety issues as the reason for not pursuing applications to U.S. Universities. This finding emphasizes how growing violence in the United States is influencing students decision making processes. It is clear that prioritizing safety and well being over the benefits of studying is a sentiment among students and their families who are worried about American campus safety.

Apart from safety concerns the survey also shed light on the impact of considerations on students choices. A large majority (80%) of students contemplating university applications expressed worries, about the associated costs. Many Canadian students are drawn to the opportunities provided by universities but the financial burden of studying in the United States serves as a major deterrent. When comparing concerns regarding cost and safety data indicates that while both factors are important safety worries seem to have an impact, on decision making. Specifically 60% of students opt out of applying to universities due to safety concerns while 80% express concerns about expenses. This difference suggests that even students capable of handling study costs may be discouraged by safety issues.

The survey results also reveal that worries about safety and expenses go beyond the application phase. When asked how these factors would affect their decision to enroll in a university a majority of students expressed concerns. A significant portion, ranging from 60% to 80% of respondents noted that both safety and costs would greatly influence their decision on university attendance. This underscores the lasting impact of these concerns on students educational decisions. The survey encompassed students from backgrounds providing a well rounded perspective, on the factors shaping their choices. The respondents fell primarily within the age range of 16 to 18 years old spanning grades 11 and 12.
The mix of genders was quite even giving us a glimpse, into the worries of both female students. This variety in demographics makes sure that the results reflect the group of high school students looking at their choices, for further education. 

Analysis:

The survey findings offer insights into how Canadian high school students view the safety and attractiveness of universities. A significant number of respondents (60%) express hesitance in applying to schools mainly due to worries about campus safety, with 40% highlighting this as their reason for not pursuing studies there. This trend highlights the impact of increasing violence in the United States on students decision making processes, as many prioritize their well being over the advantages of studying abroad. Additionally, the survey reveals that students considering universities are primarily motivated by a desire for educational programs (70%) and new experiences (60%) (refer to chart 3). However, these aspirations are tempered by concerns about the burden associated with attending these institutions, as 80% of respondents see cost as a factor in their decision making process. This contrast indicates that while Canadian youth are attracted to educational opportunities, financial constraints act as a barrier for many. However, most believe that the disadvantages outweigh the benefits. (refer to chart 2)

Incorporating student feedback enhances the analysis by providing insights into their concerns and motivations. One person shared, "My mom has this fear that I might face violence in the US because of my heritage." This heartfelt comment sheds light on the seated worries some students hold about safety on college campuses, especially those from diverse backgrounds. Another student also mentioned, "Parents see the US as unsafe," reflecting concerns among families. Considering the research question, the results emphasize how the increasing violence in the United States is influencing students choices for higher education. The data indicates a growing hesitation among students to apply to colleges due to safety issues, which could have effects on attracting and retaining international students in the US. These insights are important as they provide an understanding of the factors affecting Canadian high school students decisions about their future education. By highlighting their fears and goals, this study sets the foundation for creating strategies to address the needs and worries of this group. Moreover, these findings contribute to a discussion on how violence impacts international education, guiding policy development and implementation in this field.

According to the data, the survey highlights that 60% of those surveyed are hesitant to seek admission into colleges because of safety concerns, with 40% of them pointing out safety as their reason. Moreover, 80% of students contemplating schools have worries about the expenses involved. These statistics emphasize how important safety and financial factors are in influencing the choices made by high school students regarding their education options.

Conclusion:

This research sheds light on the relationship between how safe young Canadians feel and their choices for secondary education, especially considering the increasing violence in American schools. The survey results show that many students are hesitant to study in the United States due to safety concerns being a factor in their decision making process. The data indicates that the growing violence in the U.S. significantly influences students educational decisions, with many prioritizing their safety over the advantages of studying abroad.

The analysis also emphasizes the motivations behind students aspirations for education, focusing on the quality of academic programs and the appeal of new experiences. However, these aspirations are tempered by concerns about the costs of attending universities. Including stories from students helps us better understand the seated worries and fears held by certain individuals, particularly those from different backgrounds, highlighting how many Canadian families perceive the United States as an unsafe environment.

These findings have implications beyond decision making, impacting efforts to recruit and retain students for higher education in the United States.
As Canadian students become more conscious of safety in their decisions, there is a need for specific actions and policies to tackle these concerns and ensure the well being and academic achievements of international students.

However, it's important to recognize the limitations of this study, such as the sample size and potential bias due to the Chinese student population at Peoples Christian Academy. Looking ahead, future research could focus on increasing the sample size and including a group of participants to gain a better understanding of Canadian youth perspectives and preferences across various sociocultural backgrounds.

Based on the findings from this study, a subsequent study could be conducted to assess how effective targeted interventions are in addressing safety perceptions and enhancing the appeal of universities for students. By implementing strategies based on evidence, policymakers and education stakeholders can strive towards creating a safer and more inclusive environment for international students, promoting cross cultural exchange and collaboration in global higher education
