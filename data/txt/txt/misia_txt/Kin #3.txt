Chapter 6: The Musculoskeletal System 

Tissue: Masses of cells that are similar in function and form 
Muscle tissue: a collection of cells that shorten during contraction which creates tension that caused bodily movement
Property of muscle fibres: 
Irritability: responds to stimuli  
Contractility: shortens in length 
Elasticity: stretches and retracts back to its original position 
Conductivity: transmits nerve impulses 
Three types of muscle tissue 
Smooth muscles: 
Surround internal organs 
Contract more slowly than skeletal muscles but can remain contracted for longer period of time
Contractions are involuntary 
Muscle are made up of spindle shaped fibres and arranged in dense sheets
Cardiac muscles: 
Found in the heart
Creates the pumping action that moves blood from the heart to the whole body 
Contractions are involuntary 
Muscles are striated 
Skeletal muscles: 
Muscles are attached to the bones by tendons and other tissues
Most common muscle type (30%-40% of human body weight)
Contractions are voluntary
Muscles are striated
Musculoskeletal system: 
The body system that allows us to move 
Comprised of the bones, skeletal muscles, and connective tissues that binds bones and muscles together 
Purposes: 
Support the body and keep it upright
Allow movement
Protect body’s vital organs 
Agonist and antagonist muscle pairs 
Muscles are usually arranged in pairs called antagonistic pairs 
When one muscle contracts the other relaxed
Ex. triceps relax while the bicep contacts to lift a weight (bicep curl)
Agonist: the muscle that is the primary move of a body part
Antagonist: the counteracting muscle that lengthens 
Complex movements involve many agonist and antagonist muscle pairs as well as stabilizers
Stabilizers: Muscles that provide support and hold a joint in place while movement can occur at another joint 

Origin, insertion, and function of major muscles and muscle groups 
Skeletal muscles attach to bones either indirectly (via tendons) or directly (when the outer membrane of the muscle attaches to the outer membrane of the bone)
Attachment via tendons is the more common between the two methods 
When muscles contract, they cause the attached bones to move 
Origin: the point where muscles attach to the more stationary bone that remains fixed 
Insertion: the point where muscles that attach to the bones that moves the most 
Muscle strains and tears 
Caused by excessive twisting and/or pulling on a muscle or tendon 
Categorized into 3 degrees of severity
First: slight swelling and bruising, and pain is when a muscle is contracting or stretching 
Second: physiotherapy treatment is needed 
Third: may require surgery and rehabilitation. 6-12 months to fully repair.
Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)
NOT DUE TO LACTIC ACID 
Microscopic tears within the muscle fibres 
Usually caused when you begin a new workout routine or when you increase the duration of intensity 
Peaks 1-3 days and disappears in 5-7 days.
Tendonitis 
Irritation of tendons due to overuse 
Proper warming top and use of correct techniquem and equipment can help avoid tendonitis. 

Anatomy of the skeletal muscle and role of the nervous system 

Skeletal muscles are made up of individual skeletal muscle fibres.
These individual fibres are wrapped up in a sheath of connective tissue ( perimysium) 
These smaller bundles are further bundled together by a stronger sheath of tissue (epimysium) 
The skeletal muscle will change its properties and become one with the tendon 
The tendon attaches to the bones. This attachment occurs at the muscles origin and insertion. 
Sarcolemma: a membrane that is beneath the epimysium that surrounds the muscle bire and contains sarcoplasm 
Sarcoplasm: the muscle” cell cytoma me
Running along the length of the muscle fibres are myofibrils and myofibrils are made up of myofilaments. 
Within these myofibrils contain “thick” and “thin: filaments known as myosin and actin, respectively.
Myosin and actin are contained within repeating structural units call “sarcomeres” 
Myosin has a “head” and a “tail” life a golf club 
The myosin “head” has an attachment site for actin, and actin has a binding site for the “head” of myosin, 
Actin has two proteins called : troponin (binding rate for calcium) and tropomyosin (covers that binding site on actin)

Sliding filament theory of muscle contraction

The myosin head does not attach to actin until calcium is released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum 
Calcium bind with troponin and tropomyosin uncovers the binding site on actin so that the myosin head can bind to actin 
ATP comes and binds to the myosin head 
ATP is broken down into ADP and P, which causes the myosin head to lock in place and bind to actin. 
This attach now forms the myosin cross bridge 
ADP and P detach from the myosin“head”, and the myosin “head” slide producing a power stroke
The power stroke rotates the actin filaments which causes the muscle to contract
The myosin head remains attached to the actin until a new ATP molecule binds the myosin “head”
Once the new ATP binds to the myosin “head”, the myosin “head” detaches from actin 
Contractions continue until the brain (or you) stops sending signals to make this muscle contraction 
After you stop the activation, calcium will be removed from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and troponin and tropomyosin will cover the binding sites on the actin filament 
When muscles contract, the actin and myosin filaments overlap to one another to cause the sarcomere to shorten. 
Muscles will shorten (contract) and move the object if the load is light 
Them muscle will stay the same if the load is equal to the muscle strength


Three key energy nutrients 

Carbohydrates: 4.1 kilocalories per gram
The most important and plentiful source of energy 
Easily metabolized in our bodies
Provide materials to build cell membranes and energy for use by cells
Short term and long term energy storage, but easily accessible by the body
Formed by plants (photosynthesis) 
Glucose is the form of sugar we use, and we store excess as glycogen in our skeletal muscle and liver
Glycogen can be broken down under conditions of stress or demand of muscular activity 
Protein: 4.3 kilocalories per gram 
Unlike carbohydrates and fats, there are no “protein reserves”. All protein are part of existing body tissue or are active components of the metabolic system 
Protein is made up of 20 different amino acids
9 are considered “essential amino acids” because they cannot be synthesized by the body but must be consumed as food 
To use protein as energy it must be broken down into its separate amino acids 
The amino acid alanine is the main contributor that converts into glycogen which is then transported in the bloodstream as glucose 
Using protein as energy occurs when glycogen reserves are severely depleted (short-term starvation)

Large amounts of protein intake does not automatically result in an increase of muscle mass, lean body, or increased performance 
Excessive intake of protein supplements and strain the liver and kidneys.  

Fats: 9.3 kilocalories per gram 
Contain the most energy 
Fats are stored in muscle cells an adipose tissue and converted for energy use as “triglycerides” 
Before fats can enter the energy supply chain, the triglycerides convert to “ Acetyl-CoA” which allows it to enter the krebs cycle
acetyl-CoA becomes the primary energy source for the making of ATP within the electron transport chain 

ATP the common energy molecule 
Nutrients need to be converted into a universal form of energy- “free energy” for muscle contractions and other physiological processes in our bodies 
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the “free energy” 
ATP contains 3 phosphates and energy is released when a phosphate is broken from the ATP molecule resulting in ADP 
ATP -> ADP+P+Energy 
ATP supplies are used up quickly. In order to “reconstruct” ATPm 2 energy systems are used 
Anaerobic system: occurs quickly in the muscle fibre that uses chemicals and enzymes for powerful by short-lived physical actions (short and high intensity) 
Aerobic system:  a much more complicated process that occurs in the mitochondria. Leads to complete breakdown of glucose. Fats and protein also enter the cycle at this stage (endurance).

Metabolic pathways
Within the 2 energy systems (aerobic and anaerobic), there are 3 main metabolic pathways to restore ATP reserves.
ATP-PC ( Anaerobic alactic): occurs deep in the muscle fibre that causes quick and intense muscle contractions. Lactic acid is not a byproduct of this pathway.
Glycolysis (anaerobic lactic): partial breakdown of glucose with lactic acid as a byproduct. It doesn't involve oxygen, but it allows longer bursts of energy.
Cellular respiration (aerobic): main source of ATP during endurance events. Involves oxygen and complete breakdown of glucose to produce a large amount of atp for energy. 
Depending on the individual athlete, the sport, intensity, and duration, ATP production will vary and the metabolic pathway used will vary and the metabolic pathway used will vary. 
These pathways do not operate one at a time, but overlap during performances. 

ATP-PC (Anaerobic alactic) 
This system produces enough ATP for about 10-15 seconds (ex. 100m race) 
No oxygen is needed to produce the enormouse burst of ATP energy and occurs in the cytoplasm
Depends on the “phosphocreatine (PC)” compound that is stored in muscle and is readily accessible. 
PC reservoir is small in muscles so the muscle can sustain the required ATP during the initial phase of short but intense activities. 
The ATP resynthesis rate is the highest 
Due to a small supply of PC, most is depleted in the 10-15 sec so an athlete increasingly relies on a second system to resynthesize ATP. 
Replenishing PC occurs rapidly and requires ATP, usually from supplies during aerobic processes, and happens during the recovery period (2-5 mins)
Glucose is not metabolized as an energy source and no lactic acid is produced. 

Glycolysis (Anaerobic lactic) 

Allows an athlete to engage in a high level of performance for an additional 1-3 mins. 
Glucose is partially broken down in the cytoplasm to provide usable energy (ATP). 
Involve many biochemical steps and yields twice as much ATP compared to ATP-PC
Rapidly produces ATP without the need for oxygen
Energy produced is used to rejoin phosphate to ADP 
C6H12O6 (GLUCOSE) + 2ADP + 2P -> 2C3H6O3 (LACTATE) + 2ATP + 2H2O
The main byproduct of glycolysis is pyruvate. Under anaerobic conditions, it breaks down to form lactic acid
Lactic acid inhibits the breakdown of glucose and the muscle fibres’ ability to contract 

Cellular respiration (aerobic) 

For intense activity longer than 90 seconds or so
Occurs in the mitochondria and fats and protein as well as glucose can be used a energy source at this stage
36 molecules of ATP/glucose molecule. Produces much more than the other 2 pathways
The energy helps to sustain endurance type events 
C6H12O6 (GLUCOSE) + 6O2 + 36 ADP + 36P -> 6CO2 + 36ATP + 6H2O 
Cellular respiration involves 3 sub-pathways
Glycosis (2 ATP): pyruvate produces Acetyl-CoA instead of lactic acid 
Krebs cycle (2 ATP): Acetyl-CoA helps produce new compounds that store (high-energy” electrons 
Electron transport chain (32 ATP): “High energy” electrons pass through the ETC  and produce water and carbon dioxide as byproducts 

Chapter 8: the cardiovascular and respiratory systems 

The heart is made up specialized muscle tissue called cardiac muscle (myocardium) 
Heart is divided into 2 sides: 
Right heart pumps deoxygenated blood into the lunch (pulmonary circulation). Dark red blood. 
Left heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). Bright red blood. 
Layers of the heart 
Pericardium: outer layer that is a tough protective sac that fits loosely over the heart 
Epicardium: sits below the pericardium
Myocardium: sits below the epicardium 
Endocardium: tissue that lines of the heart 
The heart has special valves that prevent blood from flowing from the ventricles to the atria; known as AV valves 
These valves are attached to the ventricle walls by special muscular extensions called papillary muscles and chordae tendineae 
Right av = tricuspid valve
Left av = bicuspid valve 

Electrical excitation of the heart 
Cardiac muscle cells are interconnected and allow electrical signals to pass from cell to cell. 
This allied the myocardium to contract all at once so that blood is pumped 
Sinoatrial node (SA node): pacemaker
Found in the wall of the right atrium and electrical signals are initiated here.
The rate of contraction is controlled by the autonomic nervous system 
Electrical signals pass through both atria through internodal pathways and cause the atria to contract from the top down to move blood to the ventricles
Atrioventricular node (AV node):
Electrical signals to the AV node to signal the ventricles to contract from the bottom up, forcing the blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries
If the SA node is damaged, the AV node becomes the pacemaker 
Electrical activity can be measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG), showing a graph representing the electrical events that happen in the heart 

Vascular system and blood flow
Blood vessels are divided into 4 categories: 
Arteries: think walls that carry blood away from the heart
Very elastic and can stretch and retract back to its original diameter
Absence of valves due to high pressure 
Blood pressure is measured here 
Systolic blood pressure: pressure caused by the contraction of the heart 
Diastolic blood pressure: pressure caused by the relaxation phase of the heart
Arterioles: 
Smaller than arteries and are important in blood distribution to different tissues in the body 
Surrounded by rings of smooth muscles that constrict the arterioles to reduce blood flow or relax to increase blood flow 
These rings are controlled by the nervous system and chemical factors released to tissues 
Example: during exercise, constriction (reduced blood flow) may go to the intestines, but relaxation (increased blood flow) would occur at the working muscles
Autoregulation: chemical factors that are made by skeletal muscles that diffuse to the arterioles and signal to relax so more blood will flow to working muscles 
Capillaries: 
Thin vessels that only allow 1 RBC through at a time, and are made up of very thin walls to allow diffusion of substances to occur easily. 
The smallest vessel in the body that plays the important role of exchanging games ad nutrients with tissues 
Venules and veins: 
Venules are extensions of capillaries which form larger veins as the return to the heart eventually forming the superior and inferior vena cava
Veins have valves that prevent backflow because pressure in veins is low compared to arteries. 

Respiratory system chapter 8

Composed of stuctures that allow aire to flow form the outside of the body to the lungs and eventually gas exchange
3 main functions: 
Sumply oxygen to the blood 
Remove carbon dioxide from the blood 
Regulate blood pH
External respiration: the exchange of ocygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs 
Internal respiration: the exchange od gases at the tissue level 
Cellula respiration: when cells use oxygen to makw enervgy through different metabolic pathways. 

Can be split into two main structural zones: 
Conduction zone: transports filtered air to the lungs 
Composed of the mouth, the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles 
The air is at body tempertature (37C) when it reaches the respiratory zone which helps maintian body temperature and protect sensistive tissues. 
Hairs in the nasal cavity traps larger foreign substances and helps filter the air.
Respirazrtory zone: where gas exchange happens 
Composed of the alveolar ducts nad alveolar sacs 
The alveolar sacs are grape like structures that provide a large surgace for diffusion of gases into and out of the blood 
The respiratory organs have a moist surface to make gases easily dissolve and diffuse 
Capillaries surround the alveolar acs and are so thin that the distance for gas exchange is short 
Minimal distance and large surface area hel[ps to maximize the rate of gas exchange

Oxygen transport (2ways) 
Plasma: transpoers 2% of the oxygen is found in blood 
Red blood cells: through the protein hemoglobin, most of the oxygen is carried 

Carbon dioxide transport (3 ways) 
Plasma: carries 5-10%
Red blood cells: (2 ways) 
Hemoglobin: 
20% binds to hemoglobin and diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli and then exhaled 
Bicarbonate system: 
70-75% diffuses into the red blood cells and undergoes a reaction with water to produce carbonic acid
Carbonic acid breaks down to hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion 
Hydrogen ion binds to hemoglobin and bicarbonate ion diffuses into the plasma 
When blood arrives at the lungs, the process reverses and carbon dioxide is reformed, which diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli and then exhaled 
Ventilation and regulation of blood pH
Blood pH measures how acidic or basic blood is. Blood normally has a pH around 7.4
During exercise, acids may be produced and released into the blood (decreasing of pH); which means more hydrogen ions are present 
As ventilation increases, extra carbon dioxide is expelled, which causes more hydrogen ions to combine with bicarbonate ions to form carbonic acid 
Carbonic acid eventually forms dioxide and water which is exhaled. Thereby, brining the blood pH back to around 7.4
