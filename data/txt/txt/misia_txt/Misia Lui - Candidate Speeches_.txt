Student Council Speech							By: Misia Lui

	Hello! I'm pretty sure everyone here knows who I am, but my name is Misia Lui, and I’m running for student council this year. If you didn’t know, I was in the student council two years ago, when I was in grade six; which makes me an experienced member of the student council. In this position, I will definitely work hard on your behalf, listen to your ideas, and try to do everything I can to make this school better for all of us. I’m not only here today as a candidate, but also as your friend. And as a friend, I will do my best to keep you updated with any information i might possess, and try my best to communicate with you all. 

 I might not be the most responsible and smartest person here, but I am dependable and a good listener.  Just tell me your needs and I’ll try to put all my effort to make sure your ideas can be heard. Your input is of great importance to the student council. If I get into the student council, I will still need your help, because no one has all the answers or solutions to every problem, so I believe that our teamwork can do amazing things. Together we can get past even the hardest obstacles  and achieve all goals possible. As the former US President, Ronald Reagan once said, “A leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things, He is the one that gets the people to do the greatest things”. Although I found this quote online, it has a great meaning and has changed my perspectives of what it takes to be a leader. To go into more depth, it means that it's not the leader who always has to do all the work, but the leader is the person who leads others to work together and do great things. 

	Today, I’m asking for your vote. I hope you all agree that I have the qualities to become a member of the student council. Let’s all make this a better year together! Thank you :)
