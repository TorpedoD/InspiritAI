The Emergencies Act
In the spring of 2020, the Trudeau government was faced with the question of whether or not to invoke the Emergencies Act in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ultimately, none of the Premiers supported the use of the Act, and it was not used.

Keep in mind, the Emergencies Act had never been used … until 2022. During a weeks-long protest in Ottawa and several other locations in Canada, the Trudeau government used the Emergencies Act for the first time in Canadian history. It was a big deal! 

TASK #1: Read through the Emergencies Act


TASK #2: In the chart below, list the types of emergencies that the Emergencies Act has the authority to respond to. I’ve already listed the first one for you because I’m a nice guy. List the other three, and also:

Put a C (for covid) next to the type of emergency that could have been addressed during the pandemic
Put a T (for trucker) next to the type of emergency that could have been addressed during the convoy protest



TASK #3: Take a closer look at Part I: Public Welfare Emergency. What are the three types of public welfare emergencies that might be addressed?


TASK #4: Who invokes the Emergencies Act? How long does it last?


TASK #5: What are some of the checks and balances on power that are written into the text of the Emergencies Act? (see sections 58-63)
