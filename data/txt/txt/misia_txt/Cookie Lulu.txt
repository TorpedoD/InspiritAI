This is Lulu. Lulu loves cookies. 

Cookies are Lulu’s 
favourite food. 

Especially her mom’s homemade ones!

One day, Lulu is 
walking to her
 friend to eat lunch.
This is Marie, Lulu’s friend! 

Lulu sees Marie 
eating a special cookie she’s never seen before.

Later that night, 

Lulu wonders about how many cookies she hasn’t tried before. 
 
Lulu goes to sleep 
as she drifts off 
to her dreams…

Oh! Where is Lulu now? Lulu is in Cookie-Topia!

Lulu decides to 
explore her new area. 

Everything smells so good !
Lulu finds a cookie tree 
and decides to try all of the 
new special cookies. 

Hmm… what is that smell?

From afar, Lulu 
can smell her 
mom’s homemade cookies. 
Lulu realizes that even after these special cookies, she misses her mom’s cookies. 

Oh! Lulu woke up from Cookie-Topia! 

That was some dream.

Lulu wakes up and goes downstairs… 


And gives her mom a biiig hug! 


Lulu is happy with just her mom’s homemade cookies. 

Nothing could make her happier.
