 			      Debate: Spinal Cord vs. Concussion Injury

A spinal cord injury (SCI) is damage to the bundle of nerves and nerve fibers that sends and receives signals from the brain. The spinal cord extends from the lower part of the brain down through the lower back.

“Unfortunately, there are at present no known ways to reverse damage to the spinal cord. However, researchers are continually working on new treatments, including prostheses and medications, which may promote regeneration of nerve cells or improve the function of the nerves that remain after an SCI.”

There are four types of spinal cord injury: cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral. The spinal cord is surrounded by rings of bone called vertebra. These bones constitute the spinal column (back bones). In general, the higher in the spinal column the injury occurs, the more dysfunction a person will experience. The vertebrae are named according to their location.
Spinal cord injuries in the thoracic region usually affect the chest and the legs, resulting in paraplegia. The vertebra in the lower back between the thoracic vertebrae, where the ribs attach, and the pelvis (hip bone), are the lumbar vertebra. The sacral vertebrae runs from the pelvis to the end of the spinal column. Injuries to the five lumbar vertebrae. 


The researchers found that cycling injuries were responsible for 81% of TSIs. Skiing and snowboarding, aquatic sports, and contact sports followed. Aquatic sports were the cause of most spinal cord injuries.

Less than 1% of persons experienced complete neurological recovery by the time of hospital discharge.

Concussion
Defined as traumatic brain injury 
Subtle to very obvious 
Effects tiredness fatigue sensitivity to light mood
Concussions have very long term effects 
Can increase severity with each time 
7 out of 10 are concussion related 
3.8 million concussions happen every year 
From any contact sport 
63% happens in american football 
1.5 deaths BOOHOO 
42.5% suffered concussion

FOR REBUTTAL
Treatment might include surgery, medicine, and other treatments as needed. Some people might recover some function over time, but others might continue to have long-term problems. Physical and occupational therapy can help you adapt to new ways of doing things. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/acute-spinal-cord-injury#:~:text=Treatment%20might%20include%20surgery%2C%20medicine,new%20ways%20of%20doing%20things.

2nd argument: why is concussion more dangerous than spinal cord injury
Spinal injury first results from concussions
Long term effects: nausea confusion
Treatments: injured person shouldn't play sports, best treatment is resting the brain to let it heal, lots of sleep, avoid activities that require lots of concentration, slowly return to normal activity, gradually return to normal when effect subside
How to prevent: wear helmet during sports, be sober while driving and wear seatbelts, avoid falling
One concussion makes it more often to get other concussions
59% of concussions in high school wrestling is high school from takedowns and improper headgear
51% among girls in high school basketball is from collisions
Hockey is 13 times more likely to happen in an actual game than in a practice

Paraplegia. This paralysis affects all or part of the trunk, legs and pelvic organs but not the arms.


How Long Does Recovery Take? In general, this depends on the severity of the injury. Those with a very mild concussion may be able to return to normal activity in 20-30 minutes. In cases with memory loss or other Grade 2 symptoms, usually limited activities can be resumed in 24-48 hours.  Serious (Grade 3-4) concussions require refraining from sports for at least 2-4 weeks, with gradual return to full activity. The after-effects of concussions are cumulative—damage symptoms may be more severe and last longer with each subsequent injury; therefore more time should be allowed for recovery. Before resuming normal activities, the patient must not have any headaches, dizziness, trouble concentrating, confusion or memory loss, either during rest or with activity. 

The 2023 population size in the United States was estimated to be about 335 million people. The most recent estimate of the annual incidence of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) is approximately 54 cases per one million people in the United States, which equals about 18,000 new tSCI cases each year.

People with spinal cord injuries (SCI) have a high risk of mortality [1] with studies documenting in-hospital mortality rates varying from 4 to 18% [2,3,4,5,6] in acute traumatic spinal cord injury (ATSCI).

Info for rebuttal: 
A concussion is a "traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function." Concussions are a subset of the neurologic injuries known as traumatic brain injuries. Treatment is very accessible and sometimes will even go away after a good night's rest. 

Spinal cord injuries are less treatable, and in severe cases, not treatable at all. 

Minor fractures of the spine can be healed with rest and medication, however, more severe fractures might require surgery to realign the bones. If left untreated, spinal fractures can lead to permanent spinal cord injury, nerve damage and paralysis.

Common complications of temporal bone fractures include facial paralysis, CSF leak, hearing loss, and vertigo. Hearing loss can be characterized as conductive or sensorineural via bedside tuning-fork testing. Formal audiometry may be deferred to allow hemotympanum or edema resolution.
