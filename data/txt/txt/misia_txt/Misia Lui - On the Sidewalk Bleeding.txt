The body was found by Andy Smith’s girlfriend, Laura Hills. Her witness statement suggested that she found his body a little over midnight, around 12:01am. After running to find the police, they arrived at the scene at around 12:12 am. 

After a short interview with Laura Hills earlier this morning that she had with a partnering news station, DNN, she says: “my boyfriend had not returned to the dance for a while, so I went to look for him. I looked around for around 20 mins which was when I came across the alley, and my boyfriend lying there motionless on the pavement surrounded by blood.” 

Later an autopsy report showed that the cause of death was blood loss due to a stab wound around the top of the stomach area, just below the ribs. There was no murder weapon to be found anywhere around the area. The police are still investigating a suspect as of now, but the likelihood of it being the Guardians doing, a rivaling gang, is extremely possible. 

	“I was walking to my boyfriend’s house at 15 before midnight, when I came across an alley where in the distance I could see a figure lying there on the ground. I tried coming closer to get a better look…. and I guess the fact it looked like those murder scenes in a horror movie sort of spooked me out.. So I ran out of the alley and towards my boyfriend’s house. I wished I could have helped him.” said witness Angela Hills, a bystander who had seen Andy still alive, minutes before his death. 

More information will continue to be released around Andy’s background and history later this week.
