Homework: Read pages 219-227, Q’s 1, 4, 5, 6, 7 on page 228 
Introduction to Acids and Bases 
Acids and bases are _________________________________ that are important in many  consumer products and environmental problems. There are a variety of methods that can  be used to distinguish between them. For example: 
-when ___________________________ is dipped in an acid it will turn ________ -when ___________________________ is dipped in a base it will turn _________ 
As you can see, acids and bases have characteristic reactions with __________________.  What are some other properties of these substances? Can we look at the name or formula  of a substance and decide whether it will behave as an acid or base? 
Properties of Acids 
Acids are sour tasting, water-soluble molecular substances that turn blue litmus  paper red. Acids are found in many common products (see below).  


In addition, acids are so reactive that they can combine with many other substances. For example, acids react with some metals such as zinc to produce hydrogen gas. 
Acids also react with compounds that contain carbonate and hydrogen carbonate groups  such as marble to produce carbon dioxide gas. For example,

Another characteristic property of acid solutions is that they are good conductors of  electricity. This is because all acids release hydrogen ions (H+) when they  dissolve in water. For example, 
  
Naming Acids 
Binary Acids: composed of two elements, hydrogen and a non-metal.  A. Root of the non-metal name (i.e. fluor for fluoride) 
B. Add the prefix hydro- to the root name 
C. Add the ending -ic acid to the root name 
Examples: 
HF (aq) =  hydrofluoric acid
 HI (aq) =  hydroiodic acid
Naming Oxoacids  
Oxoacids are composed of hydrogen, oxygen and another element. 
A. Name of the anion, without the -ate or -ite ending. 
B. If the anion name ended with -ate, replace it with -ic at the end of the name.  C. If the anion name ended in -ite, replace with -ous
D. Add the word acid 
Examples:  
H2SO4 (aq) = sulfuric acid
HNO3 (aq) =  nitric acid 
Uses of Acids 
Strong acids release more hydrogen ions than weak acids.  Because of this difference, strong and weak acids have different uses. 
• Some weak acids are safe enough to eat. Phosphoric acid, for example, gives  carbonated soft drinks their taste. Without sweeteners, soft drinks would be almost  as sour as vinegar! Citric acid is found in citrus fruits such as oranges and in sour  candies.

• Stronger acids, such as sulphuric acid, are used to make steel, plastics, and  detergents. These acids are so important that their production has become a multi billion-dollar industry. 
Acids are very useful in the food industry: they act as a __________________________.  Harmful microorganisms cannot survive in acid. Acids such as _________________ and  ______________________ act as preservatives. Pickles, barbecue sauce, and ketchup all  have long shelf-lives because they contain a lot of vinegar. 
Properties of Bases 
On the other hand, bases are bitter-tasting, water-soluble ionic substances that turn red  litmus paper blue. They feel slippery when in aqueous solution and are found in many  common products (see below). 


Bases, like acids, are also good conductors of electricity. However, they release  hydroxide ions (OH–) when they dissolve in water. For example, 
Naming Bases 
- Same naming system as ionic compounds is used.  
- For example, NaOH = sodium hydroxide and Ca(OH)2 = calcium hydroxide

Uses of Bases 
Bases also vary in their strength depending on how many hydroxide ions they release. 
• Weak bases are safe enough to be consumed. For example, medicines used to treat  heartburn and indigestion contain weak bases such as magnesium hydroxide,  Mg(OH)2.  
• Stronger bases are used to make cleaning products. Soap, for example, is made by  cooking animal fat or vegetable oil with potassium hydroxide, KOH. Many  household cleaning products contain strong bases. 
Substances that are described as bases may also be described as ____________________.  Bases react with proteins to break them down into smaller molecules. A hair-clogged  drain may be cleared by treating it with a drain cleaner that contains sodium hydroxide  because the sodium hydroxide breaks down the protein in the hair. 
Dangers of Acids and Bases 
Acids and bases can sometimes be harmful. For instance, if water in the environment  becomes too acidic or too basic, it can harm the living organisms in it. 
Solutions that are ___________________ can be _______________________________.  For example, the sulphuric acid in an automobile battery is very acidic (pH = 0.5) – if this  were to touch your skin it would quickly cause severe burns. 
Solutions that are ___________________ can be _______________________________.  For example, sodium hydroxide, or drain cleaner, is very basic (pH = 13.5). If this were  to get in your eye it would react with protein molecules in the eye and cause blindness if  untreated. 
Formulas for Acids and Bases 
Common acids are easily recognized because their formulas either 
(i) begin with H or (ii) end with COOH. For example, 
• hydrochloric acid 
• carbonic acid 
• acetic acid

Deciding whether a substance is a base from its formula is more complicated. Most bases  are compounds that contain the hydroxide ion (OH-). But some bases are more difficult to  recognize. Substances that contain the bicarbonate ion (HCO3-) are bases because they  react with water to form hydroxide ions. For example, 
• sodium hydroxide 
• sodium bicarbonate
