Blackbird Baking Company
5 Main Street
Markham, ON L3R 6G3


Dear Hiring Committee,
	I am writing to you to express my interest in your part-time position as a bakery assistant at your Riverside location. I am currently a Grade 10 high school student at Peoples Christian Academy in Markham, Ontario. As an amateur baker, I have always taken an interest in the artisan baking process and have been a long-time customer and fan of Blackbird Bakery. I was excited to see your listing on Indeed.Com. Bread is something we consume every day, but making it is a process filled with care, craftsmanship, and hard work. I believe that baking bread and pastries are art forms that I would enjoy learning.
	I believe that I would be a great fit for this company. I have a flexible schedule that allows me to work at least 4 shifts per week, in the morning or the afternoon. I have excellent time management skills. I am a self-starter and work very well independently. I also work well in groups and am a good communicator. I am strong enough for the physical aspects of this job and can move and lift heavy objects around the bakery. I have had experience packaging before in previous jobs. I am a dedicated hard worker and will be sure to finish my job effectively, efficiently, and cleanly. I am also responsible and good with numbers and could be a reliable extra hand at the cash register. I believe I can be a quality staff member for this company, one that maintains this companyâ€™s values and vision of creativity, customer care, and craftsmanship.
	Thank you for considering me for this position. I am eager to learn and hope to be an asset to Blackbird Baking Co. I welcome any further discussion about my interests or abilities and am available for an interview at your convenience.

Respectfully,
Charlie Doe
