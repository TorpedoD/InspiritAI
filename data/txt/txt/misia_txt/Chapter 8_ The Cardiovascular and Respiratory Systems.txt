Chapter 8: The Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems
The heart is made up of specialized tissue called cardiac muscle (myocardium)
Heart is divided into 2 sides
Right heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lung (pulmonary circulation). Dark red blood
Left heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). Bright red blood
Layers of the heart
Pericardium: Outer layer that is a tough protective sac that fits loosely over the heart
Epicardium: Sits below the pericardium
Myocardium: Sits below the epicardium
Endocardium: Tissue that lines the inside of the heart
The heart has special valves that prevent blood from flowing from the ventricels to the atria, known as AV valves
These valves are attached to the ventricle walls by special muscular extensions called papillary muscles and chordae tendineae

Cardiac muscle cells are interconnected and allow electrical signals to pass form cell to cell
Allows the myocardium to contract all at once so that blood is pumped
Sinoatrial Node (SA node): “Pacemaker”
Found in the wall of the right atrium and electrical signals are initiated here
The rate of contraction is controlled by the autonomic nervous system
Electrical signals pass through both atria through internodal pathways and cause the atria to contract from the top down to move blood to the ventricles
Atrioventricular Node (AV node):
Electrical signals to the AV node to signal the ventricles to contract from the bottom up, forcing the blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries
SA node will cause the heart to contract 70-80 beats per minute
Electrical activity can be measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG), showing a graph representing the electrical events that happen in the heart

Chapter 8: Vascular System and Blood Flow

Blood vessels divided in to 4 categories:
Arteries:
Thick walls that carry blood away from the heart
Very elastic and can stretch and retract back to its original diameter
Absence of valves due to high pressure
Blood pressure is measured here
Systolic Blood Pressure: pressure caused by the contraction of the heart
Diastolic Blood Pressure: pressure caused by relaxation phase of the heart
Arterioles
Smaller than arteries and are important in blood distribution to different tissues in the body
Surrounded by rings of smooth muscles that constrict the arterioles to reduce blood flow ro relax to increase blood flow
These rings are controlled by the nervous system and chemical factors released to tissues
Example: During exercise, constriction (reduced blood flow) may go to the intestines, but relaxation (increased blood flow) would occur at the working muscles
Autoregulation: chemical factors that are made by skeletal muscles that diffuse to the arterioles and signal to relax so more blood will flow to working muscles. 

Capillaries:
Thin vessels that only allow 1 RBC through at a time, and are made up of very thin walls to allow diffusion of substances to occur easily
The smallest vessels in the body that plays the important role of exchanging gasses and nutrients with tissues
Venules and Veins: 
Venules are extensions of capillaries which form larger veins as they return to the heart; eventually forming the superior and inferior vena cava
Veins have valves that prevent back flow because pressure in veins is low compared to arteries.

Chapter 8: Returning Blood in Veins Back to the Heart

3 Main tools/Systmes:
Skeletal Muscle Pump: Skeletal muscles surrounding the veins contract to push/massage the blood back to the heart
Thoracic Pump: When a breath is taken, the pressure in the chest cavity is low, while the abdominal cavity is high. The pressure in the veins in the chest cavity drops, and the vein pressure in the abdominal cavity rises. The difference in pressure between the veins and the two cavities pushes the blood to the heart.
Nervous System: During exercise when cardiac output increases, the nervous system signals to the veins to slightly constrict which helps to return more blood back to the heart. 

Chapter 8: Blood and its Components

Blood is a specialized fluid that functions mainly as a transport medium for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients
Blood is made up of 2 components
Plasma: 55% of blood
Mostly water with dissolved nutrients, proteins, ions, and gases
Blood Cells: 45% of blood
Red blood cells (erythrocytes) make up the most which ransport oxygen and carbon dioxide through the protein hemoglobin
White blood cells (leucocytes) make up less than 1% and play an key role in the immune system
Platelets (thrombocytes) are cell fragments that help control blood clotting

Chapter 8: Cardiovascular Dynamics

Deals with how the cardiovascular system adapts to demands and changing conditions
Factors that are considered when looking at cardiovascular dynamics
Cardiac Output (Q)
Blood Pressure
Distribution of Blood Flow


Chapter 8: Cardiac Output (Q)
The volume of blood the left ventricle pumps in 1 min. Measured in L/min
3 Factors that effect cardiac output
Activity:
Rest: 5-6 L/min, Heavy Exercise: >30L/min
Stroke Volume (SV): The amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle in a single contraction
Rest: 50%-60%, Max Exercise: 85%
Heart Rate (HR): The number of times the heart beats per minute

Chapter 8: Blood Pressure

Cardiac Cycle: The series of events that occurs through one heart beat
Relaxation (Diastole): The ventricle fills with blood
Contraction (Systole): The ventricle contracts and ejects the blood
Blood pressure is measured in milimetres of mercury (mmHg) and measures the force the blood exerts on the walls of the arteries and other blood vessels
Humans range from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg
The changing pressure during the cardiac cycle is how blood is circulated throughout the body
Blood pressure is effected by the type, duration, and intensity of the exercise
Systolic blood pressure is often proportional to exercise intensity; the greater the intensity the higher the pressure (ex. Endurance exercises)
Resistance Training causes short, but large increases to both systolic and diastolic pressure
After exercise, there is a period where blood pressure drops below normal resting values (post-exercise hypotension); even with low intensity exercises
Hypertension is when blood pressure is consistently elevated (>140/90 mmHg)
Considered modifiable since it can return back to normal with lifestyle changes
Risk Factors: obesity, smoking, aging, kidney diseases, and genetics

Chapter 8: Distribution of Blood Flow

During exercise, the dean for oxygen increases; especially in skeletal muscles
The cardiovascular system tries to meet these demands by increasing cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow
Less active organs will have reduced blood flow in order to supply more blood to the working/active organs
Increase: Active skeletal muscles
Decrease: Stomach, Intestine, and Kidneys
The only organ that is unaltered regardless of the intensity of exercise is the brain
