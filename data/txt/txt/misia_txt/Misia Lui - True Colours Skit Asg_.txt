True Colours Skit

To demonstrate your understanding of True Colours, you will be writing, directing, and acting in a short skit. Your group members can choose between a few approved scenarios or create one of your own (get this approved by your teacher). Each member of the group will portray a different True Colour and should write their OWN lines but collaborate with each other to create a cohesive skit. You and your character should not share a dominant True Colour. You will also write a brief explanation of your character using the questions below as guidelines.

Your Google Doc Submission should include:
Your Name + your Group Members' names
A brief explanation of your character in the skit (What True Colour is represented by your character? How does this character demonstrate the qualities of their True Colour? What was it like writing for a character with a True Colour that was different from your own?)
Group Skit Script highlighted (Highlight your lines in the colour of your character's True Colour)
