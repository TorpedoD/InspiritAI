Buddhism Overview: 
Buddhism → India
Founded by Siddartha Gautama

“Budda”: Awakened one/enlighted one
Non-theistic religion (god is irrelevant)
Buddha third middle eye represents a state of enlightenment

Gautama:
Prince of a North Indian kingdom in the 6tgh century BC → same time Vedantic Hinduism
Prophesied that he would become a great king or great monk

Father wanted him to become a king and shielded him from experiences that would encourage a religious path: (ODDR)
Old age
Disease
Death
Religious renunciation
Before the age of 30, he observed all four scenes

Left his wife, child and a life of luxury to take up the life of an ascetic 
Self-inflicted tortured
Lived on only a grain of rice per day
Ate his own excrement

After 7 years, he hadn’t found enlightenment: 
Sat under a fig tree to mditate, and decided to either die of starvation or find enlightenment
Found enlightenment and became a Buddha the next day
This fig tree became the bodhi tree
Embarked on a life of teaching and was said that he even ascended to heaven to teach his mother and other gods

Died after eating spoiled pork that was given to him as an offering (486-483 BC)
Knew he was coming to the end of his life
Showed respect to the offering

Gautama: (Original Buddhism)
Similar to Hinduism, everything is maya → illusion
Goal: To discover one’s Anatman or non-self
The reality of non-existence → one has to become aware of Sunyata, the fundamental nothingness, the void
Continues through the cycle of samsara (until a person attains this realization)
Goal: in philosophy: Realizing one self-expectedness
According to Gautama, enlightenment is found in the middle way

Concepts incorporated into Gautama’s teaching → core beliefs of Buddhism → 4 noble truths:

4 Noble Truths: 
To live is to “suffer” (dukha)
Suffering is caused by “desire” (tanha)
Eliminate dukha by eliminating tanha
Tanha is eliminated through the noble 8-fold path

Theravada Buddhism: (Traditions of the elders)
After Gautama’s death
Council put together early writings reflecting his teaching
Writings seen as Buddhism’s official scriptures
Tripitaka: three baskets → how the palm leaf manuscripts were organized
Vinaya-Pitaka: Basket of discipline → rules of monastic life and code of conducts
Sutta-Pitaka: Basket of discourses → most important because it contains teachings of Buddha
Abhidhamma-Pitaka: Basket of Further teachings → discussion on the nature of consciousness and explanations of the Sutta-Pitaka

Two major branches of Buddhism:
Theravada (500 B.C.)
Older branch
Expression meaning of Tradition of the elders
Remained true to the teachings of Gautama
Centers on monks or bikhus

Mahayana (200 B.C.)

Keep first five precepts
Support the bikhus
Maintain the temples

Theravada Temples:
Can be plain or ornate
Contains a statue of Buddha usually sat cross-legged and doing his personal mudra

Monks and Enlightenment
Monks that reach enlightenment will enter Nirvana upon death
People that achieve Nirvana can delay entering, in order to teach others the path to nirvana. This is called a Bodhisattva
In Theravada tradition, there are 25 Buddhas, with the 26th, named Maitreya, who is a bodhisattva who is in preparation for Earth and will start a golden age of enlightenment


Theravada= only one bodhisattva
Mahayana= many bodhisattva


Mahayana Buddhism:

Mahayana means “greater raft”
A picture of development for Buddhism, as Mahayana presents a picture of a more inclusive accommodating vehicle
In Mahayana Buddhism, the followers believe that anyone can achieve enlightenment and nirvana, not just the monks as believed in Theravada Buddhism
Nicknamed Theravada Buddhism as Hinayana, “little raft”, as they believed only monks can achieve nirvana. The nickname was to show disapproval, but they adopted the name. 
4 Major Innovations
Picturing sunyata (void in Theravada), as absolute compassion instead
Sunyata, Theravada: lose oneself in complete nothingness 
Sunyata, Mahayana: find oneself in complete compassion
Growing Pantheon of divine beings
Buddhas divided into 3 categories: manushi (achieved enlightenment on earth, died and went to nirvana), dhyani (attain enlightenment in heaven, are not dead, can still help humans), and bodhisattvas (delays entry into Nirvana so that they can help others reach Nirvana)
Many bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism but only 1 in Theravada
Additional Scriptures
Sutras (meaning strings or threads)
Most important was the Lotus Sutra, attributed to Gautama (Sakyamuni)
Key Ideas/doctrines

Jesus and the Buddha on Happiness
29 year old prince Gautama Siddhartha left his wife and young child to look for the meaning of life. He observed the impermanence of the world, how nothing lasted, and that humans still desired impermanent things like life, health, possessions, etc. 
Human desires would always disappoint, so he believed that this caused human suffering. He concluded that if he could kill desire, he could be unaffected by either good or evil, his suffering would cease, and he would be happy, free from pain and samsara. 
However, what drived the Buddha’s rigorous pursuit to eliminate his desires was the desire to be happy. The Buddha believed God was irrelevant to human happiness, instead that happiness was being free from desire-induced suffering and reincarnation. True happiness was to not exist. 
Christianity’s message is to be detached from possessions but to desire the gift of God, enough to count everything else as loss in order to gain it. 
Buddha wants to be desireless and absorbed into the impersonal cosmos. Jesus wants us to deeply desire and be completely enthralled with our creator, savior, protector God. 
Jesus knows our desire for happiness and permanence was designed by God, they aren’t evil. We are designed to be satisfied with the one eternal permanent God. Evil is when we believe God won’t satisfy us and pursue happiness in something else. We fight sin not by killing desire but by abandoning our futile desires. 
Jesus and Buddha agreed pursuing ultimate happiness in transient things is futile. The Buddha says satisfaction is treasuring nothing, Jesus says it is treasuring God. In God we get all things, but in nothing, we get nothing.
