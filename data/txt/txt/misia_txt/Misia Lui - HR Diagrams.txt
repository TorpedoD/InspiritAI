The elements present in the Sun’s spectrum are hydrogen, helium, and sodium. 
Calcium is present in the mystery stars 1 and 3.
Mystery star 3 contains sodium.
Mystery star 3. 
The mystery star’s composition that is least like that of the sun is mystery star 2. 
A star’s composition can be inferred by analyzing its spectral pattern because by looking at the colours using a spectroscope we can identify what type of elements that are absorbed from the stars, this is because different elements absorb different colours that correspond to the stars making it harder for us to see without observing its spectral pattern. As well as what hidden colours we usually cannot see using regular telescope equipment can show up with this. 
The spectra I would see when analyzing the light from a full moon would be similar to the sun’s spectra. The reason is because the moonlight resource actually comes from the sun, it sort of bounces off and reflects onto the moon’s surface creating the light it has. But because of this the light difference of the moon to the sun is very big, considering it is just a reflection of it, it won’t project even half as much as the sun.

The pattern I see on the graph is overall a downward slope, with a small rise in the middle, then going right back down. 
The sun’s absolute magnitude is +4.7. 
The star Vega’s absolute magnitude is +0.65.
A star’s absolute magnitude is -.1.2.
