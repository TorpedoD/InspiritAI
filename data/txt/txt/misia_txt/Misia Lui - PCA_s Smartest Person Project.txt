PCA’s Smartest Person
Student Name: Misia Lui 
Partner’s Name: Ayden, Damian 

Your task is to design a multiple intelligence challenge inspired by those seen on the CBC show “Canada’s Smartest Person.” In groups, you will be assigned 1 intelligence at random and must create a challenge that helps to test each intelligence. Then, you will write a paragraph (or record a video) explaining the theory of multiple intelligences and how your challenges effectively test this intelligence. You will have 2 work periods to complete this.
