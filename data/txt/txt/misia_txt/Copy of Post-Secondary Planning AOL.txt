Post-Secondary Planning

As you begin to plan for your post-secondary life, it can be very helpful to start with the end in mind. Please create a Google Slide Presentation with the following information. You should have at least 5 slides (including 1 title page slide) but no more than 10 slides. Please clearly label each slide (you may use the underlined subtitles below as the titles for your slides if you would like). Please feel free to add images to add to the visual effect of your presentation. This is a part of your Culminating Assessment.
