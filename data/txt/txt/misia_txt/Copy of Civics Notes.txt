Rights - A moral or legal entitlement to have or obtain something or to act in a certain way.

Responsibilities - The state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone.

Types of Citizenship
Informed: Being aware of the needs of the communities (families, neighbourhoods, schools etc.) Understanding the workings of our government, how it operates, and its concepts, structures, and processes.
Purposeful: Understanding our role and relationship with communities and government. Being aware of the values and perspectives that guide our own and other’s actions and decisions.

Influence and Authority
Influence: The ability to change other people's thinking or actions by example, argument or force or personality.
Authority: The official power given to someone to act on behalf of others.

Compromise and Partisan
Compromise: Balancing out many different options and ideas where all options are represented to a degree.
Partisan: Some options are represented at the cost of other options.

Political Perspective and significance
Political Perspective: Holding different and even opposite points of view about the same issue.

How are political perspectives formed
Personal beliefs and values (opinions, experiences) 
Political beliefs (how you think government should work)
Where are you? What shapes you? Physical space (close or far, area do you live). Background and culture (interests, family).



Objectives and results & stability and change
Step 1 conditions: What issues need to be addressed?
Step 2 objectives: How can we make things better?
Step 3 actions: How can we best get things done?
Step 4 results: Did we meet our objectives?
Intended results: Planned outcomes that were expected
Unintended results: Outcomes that were not expected
Causes for unintended results are: Bad planning, human error, poor execution, incorrect analysis, and unforeseen events.

Stability and change
Stability: Keeping things the same
Change: Make things different
More stability -> less change
More change -> less stability

Evidence and ethical considerations
A fact that supports a conclusion and gives proof of accuracy, as well as providing understanding of what is happening.
Purpose: Helps you draw sound conclusions, support an argument for a policy or action, influence/persuade others (evidence may be biassed or inaccurate, political propaganda), helps to differentiate between facts, opinions, and arguments.

Opinion vs fact
Opinion: refers to a judgement or belief about something.
Fact: refers to something that can be verified or proved to be true.
A fact is an objective reality whereas an opinion is a subjective statement.
Both bring value to specific issues.
Good opinions are based on facts.

Propaganda
Information, especially of a biassed or misleading nature, used to promote or publicise a particular political cause or point of view.
Where are we getting our information?
Results from biassed or inaccurate information.
Evidence is where we filter truth from propaganda.

Gathering and evaluating evidence
Source: Where did it come from?
Objective: For what purpose was it created?
Usefulness: Is it relevant to the issue?
Reliability: Is it true, accurate, unbiased, and reliable?
Context: Is it supported by other evidence?
Evidence: What does it prove?
Ethical Consideration
The principles that dictate our behaviour towards each other when there is no clear right or wrong
Purpose: Helps navigate decisions that may be difficult so that the decision considers what is fair and just.

Origins of government
Latin: Gubernare meaning to direct, manage, rule or guide.
Greek: Kybernan was a seafaring term meaning to steer or pilot a ship

Athens: Innovation
2400 years ago; golden age
Democracy: rule by the people
No women
Met oh Pnyx: Hill of Athens
Met as popular assembly
Each person had rights

Athens: Impact on Canada
Canada is a democracy
We have improved on the Athenian version
More people can vote

Rome: Innovation
753 BC to 467 AD
Bureaucracy (state officials made the important decisions instead of elected representatives)
Administrative brilliance in governing large empire

Rome: Impact on Canada
Large nations like Canada borrow the bureaucratic model first used by Rome
Romans were masters at administration. They were able to govern large land masses.

Absolute Monarchy (Innovation)
Divine right of Kings
Role of government is to pay taxes, build roads, join army
Magna Carta (1215): defined rights of barons and limited the King’s power

Absolute Monarchy (Influence on Canada)
Constitutional monarchy not an absolute monarchy
The principle of the Rule of Law forms the basis for Canada’s legal system today. 


French Revolution
Conflict over changing ideas about citizenship
Rights of the Third Estate became an issue
Equality of all became the issue
Industrial Revolution altered communities

Impact on Canada
US: Declaration Independence (1776)
France: Declaration of Rights of Man (1789)
Both began the tradition of actively protecting people’s liberties
People should be protected from government power

Great Depression
Beginning of the social welfare network: Government intervention in the marketplace

Impact on Canada
Canada’s welfare state was created during these years
Old age pension and unemployment insurance were created during this time era
Canadians expected Government to help the less fortunate 

Civil Rights movement
Nature of citizenship changes drastically
Equality of all people regardless of class

Impact on Canada
The women’s movement and the civil rights movement applied pressure on Canadian society to similarly protect disadvantaged groups in our society
This era inspired the majority in Canada to try to protect the minority or the disadvantaged


Unit 2 Taking Action

Two types: 
Earned privilege: results that come from one’s effort and achievement
Unearned privilege: Privileges that come from purely change and are not                     based on the merit of the person, people, or group

Inaction has consequences
Personal Inaction: You are not going to do something when you witness a crime or incident.
National Inaction: A country/nation that is not willing to do something about a crime or incident
Global Inaction: A global matter that involves world organisations not willing to do something about a crime or incident

Law in Canada to protect people from inaction?

The Good Samaritan Law

Protection from liability

Despite the rules of common law, a person described in subsection who voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward provides the services described in that subsection is not liable for damages that result from the person’s negligence in acting or failing to act while providing the services, unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person.

Acquaintances Society: A society that gives trust and helps the society
Stranger Society: A society that gives distrust and doesn’t help the society
Bystander Effect/problem: They think others will help because there's other people around


Role as a Christian

Call to Love: John 15:12-13. “ My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”
Call to Respond: Parable of the Good Samaritan.
Call to Love our enemies: Love your enemies

Civic Duty as a Christian

Philippians 3:20: but our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ
Greatest example of injustice in all of human history is Jesus. He lived the life we should have lived, died the death we deserved to die.

Unit 3 Rights

What rights are not
Demands

Wishes

What are rights?

Rights: A legal or natural entitlement to have something or to do something without interference
Human Rights: Rights that all humans are born with and do not come from the laws of any specific society
Legal Rights: Rights that reflect the customs and values of a society. They are protected by laws
Equal Rights: The idea that all citizens are entitled to the same rights equally

The purpose of Equal Rights

Purpose: To protect individuals and groups from justice. Intolerance, prejudice, persecution, conquest, enslavement
Rights help determine what behaviours are morally acceptable
Equal rights have been fought for and are enjoyable today because of persistence and sacrifice
It is our civic duty to protect these rights as there is no guarantee that our rights will not be taken away.

What are rights that prevent injustice?

Right to liberty →  slavery
Right to Life →  Genocide
Freedom from discrimination →  Prejudice
Freedom of Speech →  Censorship

Human Rights vs Legal Rights

Human Rights are inalienable and universal
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
The UN is a declaration not a hard law
Legal Rights can change based on countries or cities you live in


Human Rights

Universal Declaration of Human Rights

1498 by the United Nations
Outlines essential characteristics for peace, freedom, and justice in the world
Not legally binding (helps form various nations own policies) 
Rejects all forms of discrimination
All people have the right to: life, liberty, and security
Freedom from discrimination
Equality before the law
Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
Food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and social services 
Education

Positive Rights and Negative Rights

Positive rights → What everyone is entitled to have. Ex. Access to health care, Equal treatment under the law
Negative rights → What cannot be taken away from everyone . Ex. Free speech, Right to own property

Rights in Canada

Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: Rights that all Canadians are entitled to have 
Exceptions: 
Limitations Clause - Other laws may limit Charter Rights if the laws are reasonable and just in a democratic society.
Notwithstanding Clause - Provinces can temporarily override Charter Rights         for up to 5 years

Non - Charter Legal Rights

Rights that are not found in the charter but are in Federal and Provincial Legislation
Ex. Education is defined by laws in each individual province. Health care is set by the Federal Government 







Group Rights

Group Rights: Claimed by groups of individuals who share common features that are unchangeable (ex - gender) 
Some of these groups would include: Indigenous peoples, Ethnic minority groups, Women, Children, People with disabilities
Each group holds specific rights separate from the rights of individuals
Pattern of discrimination against them as they are not always treated equally (ex - children) 

Rights must be protected

They are violated on a daily basis
Having rights means that there is a responsibility to protect them for the common good
Having Rights = Having Responsibilities = Protecting One’s own Rights = Protecting Everyone’s rights = the Common Good

Common Good

Common = Involving the whole community
Good = Something that is beneficial
Common Good = Something that is beneficial to the community as a whole
The government is working towards the common good
Common Good should benefit everyone equally

Political Spectrum

A political spectrum is an imaginary line that contains the range of opinions that exist on how to run a government and how to approach a political problem

Role of the Government

Provide the parameters for everyday behaviour for citizens
Protect them from outside interference
Provide for their well-being and happiness
Work towards the Common Good

How much should rights matter our Government

Protects and affects community




Canadian Political Spectrum

Left: Liberal, NDP, Green Party of Canada, Bloc Quebecois
Right: Conservatives
Candians are quite left-wing socialists overall… U.S. Republicans, for example are much further right-wing than Canadian Conservatives

How does it work

People use political spectrums to help them keep track of where a party “sits”, ideologically, on a certain issue
This means that the spectrum helps organise the political platforms of the major political parties
NDP: Less spending on the military–money should instead go to social programs
Liberals: Maintain current spending on the military
Bloc Quebecois: Halt spending on the military until Canadian foreign policy justifies an increase; make French the official language of the army in Quebec
Conservatives: Increase spending on military

Government Structure in Canada

Different levels of government

Canada operates in a multi-level system of government: Federalism
Purpose: To meet the needs of citizens who live in vastly different regions and have diverse needs
Each level of government ahs a leader and has power and responsibility to meet the needs of its population

Federalism

From the top → Bottom
Federal Government = Government of Canada. Leader: Prime Minister
Provincial Government = 10 Provinces + 3 Territories. Leader: Premier
Municipal Government = City, Town and Districts. Leader: Mayor 

Band Councils

Elected Local Governments by First Nations
Chief: Registered Band Members
Grand Chief: Two or more bands: Regional
National Chief: National


Responsibilities

Municipal: Animal Control, Emergency Services, Garbage and Sewage, Land-Use Planning, Public Transit, Water
Provincial: Education, Health, Environment, Property and Civil Rights, Highways
Federal: Aboriginal Affairs, Citizenship, Immigration, Fisheries, Foreign Affairs, National Defence, Shipping/Railways

Yes, We Do

There exists ‘local issues’ and ‘national issues’ which require different governing authorities to make informed and accurate decisions
There are many various issues that arise in each level of government
They may vary in urgency, and significance
All levels of government play a significant role in Canadian government

Why we need separate Branches of government

All organisations have different structures, roles, and responsibilities
Canadais structured into 3 branches
Legislative Branch: Power to make laws
Executive Branch: Power to administer laws
Judicial Branch: Power to apply laws






Legislative Branch

Represent citizens’ interests in government debate and pass new laws
Monitor Government policies and actions

Executive Branch

Set government policy 
Initiate and draft new laws
Administer, implement, nad enforce laws and policies

Judicial Branch

Interpret and apply laws through court cases and decisions 
Strike down laws that are unconstitutional

Power to Choose the Government

The Electoral System

The legal system where people vote, votes are counted, and the people are elected or chosen to run the government
There are different electoral systems and Canada uses the First-past-the-post system

First-Past-The-Post system

Features of this system include: No limit of candidates who can run for election, The candidate who gets the most votes wins, you don’t need to get a majority (more than 50%), just the most votes
This system helps to ensure there is a winner in the election even when vote turnout is low 
Canadians regularly win elections with far less than a majority of voters’ support

Canada’s Voter Turnout

Voter turnout in Canada has reached an all time low
In some elections less than half of eligible voters actually vote
In a recent election, non voters believed the following: 28% said they weren’t interested, 23% said they were too busy



How Does The System Work?

Step 1: Electoral Districts
Provinces and Territories in Canada are divided into ridings (district or boundaries)
Voters choose their elected representative, who sits in the legislature on their behalf
Step 2: Candidates
Candidates announce they will run in the election
There is no limit to the number of candidates who can run in a district
Political parties nominate their candidate representative
Candidates can run without being linked to a party
Step 3: Election Campaign
Candidates and parties try to convince voters through advertising, media reports, phone calls, and social media campaigns
Step 4: Voting
Voters go to polling station in their district on election day
Voters receive a paper ballot with all of the candidates’ names, make a mark beside the person they choose, and place the ballot in the ballot box
Step 5: Counting Votes
When polling stations are closed, ballots are counted
The candidate with the most votes wins that election in that district
Step 6: Forming Government
The political party with the most votes is asked by the Crown to form a government
The party with the second most votes forms the official opposition
Step 7: Government leader
The party leader of the winning party become the leader of the government
Government leader is responsible for managing all government services, departments, employees
Step 8: Cabinet
The prime minister chooses other elected representatives to form the cabinet 
Each cabinet member helps the prime minister manage a specific part of the government


Majority vs Minority

Ex: If there are 308 members in a legislature

Majority Government:
First place party wins 158 seats/308 or 51%
Second place party become the official opposition
Party A does not need the support of other parties

Minority Government:
First place party wins the most seats, but less than 158 or lower than 51% 
Second place party become the official opposition
Party A needs the support of other parties

Types of Voters

Responsible Voters: Those that challenge their assumptions and think critically about what they see, hear, and read before voting
Dogmatic Voters: Those that are absolutely certain that they are right regardless of what the evidence says
Popular Opinion Voters: Those that vote one way because that is what everyone else is doing

Fundamental Justice

Fundamental: Basic and Essential
Justice: Being fair and reasonable
Rights and Freedoms can only be limited or denied through a process that is fair and just
Fundamental justice provides fair and impartial justice equally
No one is above the law or excluded from its protection
The justice system and fundamental justice allows for the development of peaceful communities
Settling matters using power, privilege, and violence leads to disturbed communities

Conflict

The rights and interests of one group or individual
VS (Justice system applies fundamental justice to settle conflicts and disputes)
The rights and interests of another group or individual


Injustice

Misuse of Power and Privilege found in a formal process and institution

Systemic Injustice:
When Basic processes and institutions are in place, but create injustice
Some groups and people are put above the law
Lack of law enforcement results in injustice

Justice system protects the Common Good

Maintaining law and order
Protecting fundamental rights
Preventing abuse and exploitation
Settling disputes
Catching and punishing wrongdoers

Two types of disputes

Type 1: Criminal Law
Serious and harmful conduct seen as a threat to all of society
Criminal code of Canada states the minimum and maximum penalties for each crime

Type 2: Civil Law
Settles disputes between individuals or groups

Criminal Law Procedure

Also known as a trial
Person charged is called the accused or defendant
A defence attorney fights for the rights of the accused
Crown attorney represents the society and is given the responsibility of proving that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt
The crown attorney does not represent the victims of the crime
Judgement is done by either a judge or jury based on the facts and what the law says should happen when someone breaks it
A jury’s decision must be unanimous to be found guilty
If the accused is found guilty, the judge will determine the appropriate punishment


Civil Disputes

Torts: Wrongful or negligent acts causing damage or injury to others
Labour Law: Disputes between employer and employee about their employment
Family Law: Disputes over family matters such as divorce, child custody, and support payments
Estate Law: Disputes over inheritance after someone dies
Property Law: Disputes between people about land ownership and property rights
Contract Law: Disputes resulting from failure to live up to the terms of a formal agreement

Citizenship and Global Change

Requirement for Voting has Changed

Today:
Canadian Citizen
18 years or older
On the voters’ list
Past:
21 years or older
Own land
Caucasian Male
Able-Bodied
Relative in the Military

History of Voting

1918: Caucasian women have the right to vote in Federal elections
1947: Asian Canadians have the right to vote
1950: Inuit men and women have the right to vote
1960: First Nations people can vote without losing their Indian Status
1970: 18 year olds can now vote
2000: Homeless people can vote

Taxation

Before 1914: Did not have to pay federal income taxes 
After 1917: Income taxes were introduced to help pay for WWI 
Many different types of taxes that help the government pay for various services
paying taxes is an important responsibility that citizens have 
Taxes:

Animal control
Education
Emergency services
Employment insurance
Environmental regulation
Family and children’s services
Garbage collection 
Health care
National defence
Police and courts of law 
Public transit

Changes in rights and Responsibilities

The role of government is directly connected to economic prosperity
Ex: Country is less wealthy → less money to give the government (taxes) → less services and control

The debate
Citizens have less social responsibility and fewer rights

VS
Citizens have more rights and privileges but also have more responsibilities

Allegiance to Canada

People who choose to become Canadian citizens have to take the Citizenship Oath
This oath promises to uphold the laws of Canada, and commit to fulfil the duties of citizenship
