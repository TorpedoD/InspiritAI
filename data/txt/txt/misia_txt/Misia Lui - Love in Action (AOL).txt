Paragraph about the experience and what you learned/took away from the assignment. (T, A, C)

The person I chose was my childhood friend. Her love language I’m guessing is physical and quality as well. After we did the activities I asked her to take the quiz and found out her love language was quality time. I knew what her love language was and already because I’ve spent a lot of time with her since I was really small. I remember she’d always be super happy whenever she met me and our other friends when we hung out, and really sad when she couldn’t due to homework. 

For our activity, it was more of a regular hang out at her house with a few other friends, and just so happened to be within the deadline of this assignment. We just hung out and finally got to spend time together and talk to each other with our other friends after not seeing each other for so long. One specific activity that also included physical touch as a love language was when we all chased each other around the house like we were 5 year olds. Our other friend took my phone and he took a picture of the moment of my latching onto her. At the end of the day we all had lots of fun and were very happy.

I realized that giving people their own form of love languages is really important, because if not they will feel left out and insignificant. It wasn’t hard to give my friend their “love”, because I’m already used to it, but I feel like if it was something like acts of service or gifts as a love language, it would be a little harder for me.
