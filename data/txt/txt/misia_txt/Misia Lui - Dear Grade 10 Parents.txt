Dear Grade 10 Parents. This year, the students will be learning about many social justice issues in the novel studies for English. One of the Novels is titled “Dear Martin” by Nic Stone. This novel has incredible themes surrounding how black teenagers are still today experiencing forms of racism. The book has some major themes including racism, sexual inuendos and concepts that are normalized for teenagers that live in marginalized communities in the U.S.A. This form is to grant permission for the student to be able to read and study the novel. If there are any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me at jradder@pca.ca. 

In the event that the student is unable to read the novel, an alternative will need to be discussed and planned with the teacher.
