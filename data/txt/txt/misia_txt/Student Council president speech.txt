Good afternoon everyone! My name is Misia Lui and I’m running as student council president for this upcoming year. I have been in PCA for the 13 years since JK, and for the past two years, I have been in the student council as secretary. So finally, as my last year in grade 12, president will be a big change; but let me tell you why I am a good 2024-2025 candidate for this position. In the past years of being apart of the student council, I have contributed to the many events throughout the school year such as minute-to-win it events, house day, and most importantly, semi-formal and prom. PCA has always been apart of my life, and I want to contribute to the school to the best of my capacity. This year, I want to bring more excitement and hopefully more anticipated events. I will try my absolute best to make them memorable and better than ever for everyone. My previous experiences through student council, being a student ambassador, being a youth leader at my church, and lots of volunteering at centers and outside faculties have taught me the importance of hardwork, dedication, and leadership. I truly believe that I can show these attributes in the following year through being president; along with having a lot of creativity, and good management and communication skills, I hope you will trust me to plan out a year full of enthusiasm and school spirit! Now, through future big ideas I will have later, I will also need a lot of your input. Trusting me as your president, as well  as the rest of the student council, we will try our absolute hardest to bring them all to reality. I believe above all, having faith in Christ is the most important, as we should all work through Him. I am growing in my walk with God day by day, and I want to make sure to incorporate all that I do to honour Him. So, with all of this in mind, vote Misia for president ! (You don’t have a choice)
