Home 

Not just one place
It can be anywhere or anything
A place to relax and forget about everything
When clouded in negativity and cynical thoughts, the moment you touch home, like heavy dust being blown off a table, all of it disappears. 
Home isn’t assigned, it is made. 
A place of comfort. If a single hug can melt away impurities of the mind, that is home. 
Relief, flow 
Free-flowing in an endless swimming pool. 
No judgement, no cares
A cultivation of precious memories, like a precious sanctuary 
In cold winter weather, this is a warm shower 
The ultimate safespace, the ultimate outlet. 


Family

Love. Unconditionally 
Two types of family: The ones you are biologically linked to, and the ones you create
No matter how much you run from it, family will always find their way back to each other 
There are those who have distorted views of family. That is still family. But do not think that that is what defines all families. 
Cultivated throughout the years 
It's only the first time parents are living too 
For the ones created: May not be relatives that create family, maybe its friends, maybe church community 
For the ones biologically linked: dna strands like ribbons connect us together through maybe what we call fate, or simply the lineage of God’s creation. 
Warm apple pie, vanilla ice cream 
Apple and cinnamon, flour an sugar. All make up the pie.
Vanilla ice cream. Not related through direct ingredients, yet compliment the pie perfectly. Unity. 
Does not necessarily need to be by blood. It is by the heart.
