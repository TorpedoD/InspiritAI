	I think there is a value in knowing what type of smart you are. This is because ever since different types of smarts existed, it helped you identify what areas of study or just lifestyle may be better for you. Not knowing this and just living as if someone is “smart” or not may get you by, but you might never go to areas where you would be best fitted if you don’t understand how you are smart. 
I am self smart and musical smart. I agree with the results of this quiz, because I can see specific examples of them in my life. Examples for music smart are how my parents, specifically my dad and all my instrument teachers have told me I have really good musical hearing; I didn’t really realize it at first though. I can also seem to perfectly memorize songs and tunes that intrigue me; and can sing from low to high octaves without being flat or sharp. As for being self smart, I agree with this because I’ve spent a lot of time just by myself, and overtime I’ve learned to analyze my own mind and the actions I’ve done daily; which apparently I’ve learned recently other people don’t do. Another example would be how the trial and error method works really well for me. It might take once or twice in order for me to understand where I went wrong, but eventually and pretty quickly, I can do things well. 

My two lowest intelligences are math and nature smart. 
For math smart, after looking at the practice section in the website, two strategies to strengthen this intelligence is:
Play games that require critical thinking.
Write the directions for completing a simple job like starting a car or tying a shoe.
For nature smart, two strategies to strengthen this intelligence is: 
Spend time outside noticing patterns in nature.
Read books and articles about nature and the environment.
