Chapter 5: Anatomical Position
The anatomical position is the starting position where you begin to describe the body’s anatomical and physiology features, positions, and movements.
3 diagram rules:
The person is upright and standing with their head, eyes, and toes pointing forward
Feet are together and arms are slightly to the side
Forearms are supinated (palms of the hands are facing forward

Lines:

Midline: The vertical line that divides your body symmetrically.
Anterior/Posterior: Anterior is the front surfaces of the body, while posterior is the back surfaces. These can also be used in relation to other structures. For example, the heart is posterior to the sternum, while the sternum is anterior to the heart
Superior/Inferior: Superior refers to heading towards the head, while inferior is heading away from the head. 
Medial/Lateral: Medial means towards the midline, while lateral is away from the midline
Proximal/Distal: Proximal towards the point of attachment of the limb to the body, distal is farther away from attachment. For example: the elbow is proximal to the wrist, the knee is proximal to the ankle, the toes are distal to the ankle, the fingers are distal to the shoulder. 
Superficial/Deep: Superficial means on or close to the surface of the body, while deep means farther away from the surface. For example, a scrape on the knee is likely superficial, while a cracked rib would be deep. 

See pg. 119, Fig. 5.1


Chapter 5: Anatomical Planes

Anatomical Planes - Refer to positions in space
3 planes
Frontal Plane: Separates the front and back of the body
Transverse Plane: Separates the top and bottom of the body
Sagittal Plane: Separates the left and right side of the body

See pg. 121. Fig, 5.2

Chapter 5: Anatomical Axes
Anatomical Axes - Describe the movement of the body or joint

3 Axes
Frontal Axis - Intersection of the Sagittal and Frontal Plane
Sagittal Axis - Intersection of the Sagittal and Transverse Plane
Vertical Axis - Intersection of the Sagittal and Frontal Plane


Homework: Memorize the terms and get a good grasp of these combinations




Chapter 5: Joint Movements

Flexion/Extension: Flexion is bending at the joint, and extension is straightening
Abduction/Adduction - Abduction is moving body segments away from your body (i.e. lifting your arms), while adduction is moving them closer to the body. (i.e. bring your arms to your side
Supination/Pronation - Supination is rotating the wrist so your palms face forward, and pronation is rotation where your palms face downward.
Plantar Flexion, Dorsiflexion - Plantar flexion moves the ankle joint like when your stand on your tiptoes, and dorsiflexion moves your ankle so your toes move closer to your shin
Inversion/Eversion - Inversion is when your stand on the outer edge of your foot (i.e. rolled ankle). And eversion is standing on the inner edge of your foot.
External rotation/Internal rotation - External rotations twist or turn away from the midline, and internal rotation moves towards the midline. 
Circumduction - movement in a circular pattern that involves flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. 
Elevation/Depression - Elevation movement that goes upwards, and depression is movement that goes downwards
Protraction/Retraction - Protraction moving forward (i.e. chin out), retraction moving backwards (i.e. squeeze shoulders back
Opposition/Reposition - opposition is when the thumb comes into contact with another finger, and reposition is when the thumb goes back to it’s resting position

Chapter 5: Human Skeleton
Made up of 206 bones, but at birth, there are more than 300
As you grow bones fuse together (i.e. skull of a newborn baby) resulting in 206 bones. 
Many parts of the body are made up of several bones joined together (Radius and Ulna)
Male vs. Female Skeleton
Males have thicker and longer legs and arms
Females have a wider pelvis to facilitate the birth process
The skeleton supports the body and works with muscles to cause movement, while also providing protection (i.e. Skull, Rib Cage, Vertebral Column)

5 Main Functions of the Skeletal System
Structural System
Support for soft tissue
Protection
Protective cage for vital organs
Growth Centre for Cells
RBC and platelets are made in bones
Reservoir of Minerals
Calcium and phosphorus can be tapped when the body needs it.
Movement
Muscles attach to bones by tendons. Muscles contract and bones move.

Bone Composition
Calcium Carbonate and Calcium Phosphate
60-70% of bone weight
Provides msot of the bone’s stiffness and resistance to pressing or squeezing forces
Calcium deficiency results in having more brittle and breakable bones (increases with age)
Collagen (Protein)
Give bone flexibility
Helps to resist pulling and stretching forces
Collagen is lost progressively as you age making bones weak and brittle

Water 
Bones contain less water compared to other organs

The 5 types of bones
Long bones
Found in arms and legs (Ex. Femur and Humerus), any bone whose length greatly exceeds its diameter
Flat Bones
Flat, thin, and protect vital organs (ex. Ribs, Sternum, Clavicle, Scapula)
Irregular Bones
Odd looking bones in face and vertebrae
Sesamoid Bones
Oval shaped bones. Found in tendons (ex. Patella in knee)
Short bones
Commonly found in wrists; good shock absorber

Structure of the Skeleton
The purpose of the skeleton is to protect body organs and act as a supoprting framework
The bones making up our skeleton are living tissues complete with blood supply and nerves
The Skeletal System (206 Bones) is divided into the following area…
Axial Skeleton (80 Bones)
Mainly made up of vertebral column (the spine), most of the skull, and the rib cage
Protection examples: Cranium (Brain), Stacked Vertebrae (Spinal Cord), 12 Pairs of Ribs (Lungs and Heart)
Appendicular Skeleton (126 Bones)
Refers to the movable limbs and their supporting structures
6 Major Regions
Pectoral Girdle (4 bones): Left and right clavicles and scapula
Arms and Forearms (6 bones): Left and Right humerus, radius, and ulna
Hands (54 Bones): Left and right carpals, metacarpals, and phalanges
Pelvis (2 Bones): Left and right hip bones
Thighs and Legs (8 bones): Left and right femur, patella, tibia, and fibula
Feet and ankles (52 bones): Left and right tarsals, metatarsals, and phalanges

Chapter 5: Long Bone Structure

Cartilage
Allows smooth movement within joints and protects the ends of bones
Medullary Cavity
The inside shaft of the bone
Filled with red and yellow bone marrow
Red bone marrow makes red blood cells and yellow marrow is made of adipose (fat) cells
Compact Bone
The dense part of the bone that provides structural integrity
Low porosity and collagen, but high mineral content
Less flexible and stiffer, better at resisting stress
Cancellous Bone (Spongy Bone)
Filled with marrow in small cavities
High porosity and collagen, but low mineral content
Not as stress resistant. Provides more flexibility and shock absorption (i.e. vertebrae)
Epiphyseal Plates and Lines
These plates are known as Growth plates and are found at different locations in ephiphyses
Epiphyseal lines occur when the growth plates come together and fuse. Once this occurs, no growth will happen


The Long Bone is divided into 2 main sections:
Epiphysis:
Makes up both ends of the long bone.
Cartilage, cancellous bone, and compact bone can be found here
Diaphysis:
Makes up the middle of the long bone.
Medullary cavity and compact bone can be found here


Chapter 5: Effect of Fitness, Bone formation, and Remodelling

Effect of Fitness on Bone
Bones become denser and more mineralized when subjected to regular physical activity and habitual loads
For benefits, loads should exceed the bones normal accustomed load
Inactivity has the opposite effect, leading to decrease in bone density and strength
Bone Formation
Ossification (Building new bones)
Compact Bone
Osteoblasts produce osteoid which help form hardened mineral known as bone
Cancellous Bone
Osteoblasts produce osteoid which forms a bundle of fibre
Bone Remodelling (Replacing Bones)
Osteoclasts
Release acids and enzymes to remove old bone
Osteoblasts
Deposit new bone tissue

Chapter 5: Bone Injuries and Bone Disease
Bones can be repaired, but usually a cast or splint is used so that the bones can reattach properly and avoid potential complications
Fractures: Known as “breaks” and are divided into 3 types depending on the severity of the break.
Simple:
When there is a break or crack in the bone, but no separation of the bone into parts
Sometimes known as “Hairline fracture” or “Greenstick Fracture:
Compound:
When the bone breaks into separate pieces. Usually occurs from a major blow.
Sometimes known as “Transverse fracture”
Comminuted: 
When the break results in bones being shattered into many pieces. This might occur in a major car accident.

Symptoms of fractures include
Sharp Pain
Tenderness
Swelling
Discoloration of the skin
Grating or grinding movement
Stress Fracture:
When muscles are too fatigued to absorb the impact of the activity, these shocks are transferred to the bone causing tiny cracks in the bone. 

Shin Splints
Painful condition that happens in the tibia due to overuse and inadequate recovery time

Aging:
Osteoporosis: The degeneration of bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue which causes fragility and increases risks of bone fractures. 
Common areas; Hip, Spine, Wrist
“Silent Disease” because people don’t know they have it until a sudden fall or bump that causes a fracture, revealing the bones weakness.
No cure for osteoporosis
Preventative Measures
Balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D
Weight bearing exercises
Healthy lifestyle (no smoking or excessive alcohol)
Bone density testing and medication
Remodelling
Declines from the 4th decade onward
Bone remodelling reverses - reabsorption occurs to prevent too much bone loss
5-10% bone mass lost per decade


Chapter 5: Different Types of Human Joints
Joints are when bones connect with one another. They are held together by connective tissue and ligaments to ensure stability of the joint. 
They play an important role in movement.
They are sites of great stress and can be common places of injury
Articular System: The areas where joints and surrounding tissues connect so that movement is possible

3 Main Types of Joints
Fibrous Joints
Tightly bound together and allow no movement
Ex. Sutures of the Skull
Cartilaginous Joints:
Bones that connect to one another by cartilage and have limited movement
Ex. “Discs” in the spinal column. Hard outer ring and soft core. Which allows movement, but also protects against intense jolts like landing on your feet. 
Synovial Joints
Joints that allow the most movement (usually the ones that come to mind)
Ex. Knee, Shoulder, or Ankle

Chapter 5: Types of Synovial Joints

6 Types of Synovial Joints
Joints are categorized based on how many axes they can move in
Uni-axial (1), Bi-axial (2), Tri-axial (3)
Ball and Socket Joints
The “ball” at one bone fits into the “socket” of another
Most maneuverable joint that allows movement in all 3 axes (Ex. Hip and Shoulder)
Gliding Joints
Flat or slightly curved bone surfaces slide against one another (ex. Foot Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion)
Hinge Joints
A convex portion of one bone fits into a concave portion of another
They allow movement in one plane (Ex. Fingers)
Pivot Joints
A rounded point of one bone fits into a groove of another
Allows rotation in one plane (Ex. Head-Signaling no)
Saddle Joints
Allow movement in two planes (Ex. Thumb)
Ellipsoid Joints
Allows movement in two planes (Ex. Wrist)

Chapter 5: Characteristics of Joints

Articular Cartilage
Found at the end of bones that connect with one another
Allows smooth contact between the surfaces as they move
Joint Capsule
Bag like outer-structure that protects the structures within
Lined with a synovial membrane that allows nutrients to pass into the joint
Joint Cavity
The space between the bones of a synovial joint
Filled with synovial fluid that acts as a lubricant and provides nutrients to the articular cartilage
Fibrous Capsule
Prevents synovial fluid from leaking out
Bursae
Small fluid filled sacs at friction points between tendons, ligaments, and bones
Intrinsic Ligament
Thick bands that help reinforce the joint capsule
Extrinsic Ligament
Support the joint and connect the articulating bones of the joint
Prevents dislocation during normal movement

Chapter 5: Joint Injuries, and Wear and Tear

Osteoarthritis:
When the articular cartilage at the end of bones is gone due to heavy usage and the surface of bones begin to erode
Joint pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility occurs
Joints are not as able to absorb shock which can lead to fractures and injuries
It is an irreversible condition
Treatments include pain medication and joint replacement (i.e. knees and hips)
Bursitis:
Inflammation of the bursae because of friction between tendons, ligaments, and bones

Sprains
When ligaments are stressed to its threshold they will stretch minimally, but more often they will tear
Sprians occur when these ligaments are overstretched
They are classified using a grading scale to determine severity
1st degree:
A few ligaments are stretched, minimal swelling and some pain
2nd Degree:
Partially torn ligament fibers. Damage and swelling is wide spread with considerable pain
3rd Degree:
The entire ligaments completely or near to completely torn. Surgery is an option to reattach the ligament to the bone

Sprain Treatment
Treatment in the first 24-48 hours is critical
Follow P.I.E.R or R.I.C.E
Pressure: Wrap the area to reduce swelling, but not so tightly that it prevents circulation
Ice: Ice the injured area to reduce the swelling. Do not ice the injury directly. Use a cloth as a barrier to avoid damage to the skin
Elevate: Try to get your injured body part higher than your heart, if possible
Rest: Activities needs to stop until the healing has progressed to where you can gradually start using the injured body part

Dislocation
When a bone is displaced or “pops out” from its joint.
Often casued by collisions or falls, and are common in fingers and shoulder joints.
Usually only a trained professional can successfully put it back in place.
Symptoms:
Significant pain and inability to move the appendage from its current place
Numbness or not feeling in the appendage
Unusual square appearance of the joint area or visibly noticeable lack of bone in the joint area
Separation
Unlike a dislocation, the joint in a separation is intact
The ligaments that attach to the bone into place are torn which causes separation
For example: A shoulder separation is caused when the ligaments attaching your collarbone (clavicle) to your shoulder blade (scapula) are torn.
Collisions or an awkward fall can cause the bones to separate
Symptoms:
Pain at the end of the bone or over the joint
Swelling and an obvious lump where the joint has been disrupted
Pain when moving

Chapter 6: The Musculoskeletal System

Tissues: Masses of cells that are similar in function and form
Muscle Tissue: A collection of cells that shorten during contraction which creates tension that causes bodily movement
Property of Muscle Fibers:
Irritability: Responds to stimuli
Contract: Shorten in Length
Extensibility: Extends in length
Elasticity: Stretches and retract back to its original position
Conductivity: Transmits nerve impulses
Three types of Muscle Tissue
Smooth Muscles
Surround internal organs
Contract more slowly than skeletal muscles but can remain contracted for a longer period of time
Muscles are made up of spindle-shaped fibres and arranged in dense sheets
Cardiac Muscles:
Found in the heart
Creates the pumping action that moves blood from the heart to the whole body
Contractions are involuntary
Muscles are striated
Skeletal Muscles: 
Muscles are attached to the bones by tendons and other tissues
Most common muscle type (30-40% of human body weight)
Contractions are voluntary 
Muscles are striated
Musculoskeletal System:
The body system that allows us to move
Comprised of the bones, skeletal muscles, and connective tissues that binds bones and muscles together
Purposes:
Support the body and keep it upright
Allow movement
Protect body’s vital organs
Agonist and Antagonist Muscle Pair
Muscles are usually arranged in pairs called Antagonistic Pairs
When one muscle contracts the other relaxes
Ex. Triceps relax while the bicep contracts to lift a weight 
Agonist: The muscle that is the primary mover of a body part
Antagonist: The counteracting muscle that lengthens
Complex movements involve many agonist and antagonist muscles paris as well as stabilizers
Stabilizer: Muscles that provide support and hold a joint in place while movement can occur at another joint


Homework: Choose 2 antagonistic pairs and create 4 exercises (2 pairs, 4 exercises)

Pairs: 

Deltoids/Lats

Lateral Raises, Pull Ups

Quadriceps, Hamstrings

Squats, Hamstring Single Leg Deadlifts

Origin, Insertion, and Function of Major Muscles and Muscle Groups
Skeletal muscles attach to bones either indirectly (via tendons) or directly (when the outer membrane of the muscle attaches to outer membrane of the bone)
Attachment via tendons is the more common between the two methods
When muscles contract, they cause the attached bones to move
Origin: The point where muscles attach to the more stationary bone that moves the most
Insertion: The point where muscles that attach to the bone that moves the most


Chapter 6: Muscle and Tendon Strains

Muscle Strains and Tears
Caused by excessive twisting and/or pulling on a muscle or tendon
Categorized into 3 degrees of severity 
First: Slight swelling and bruising, and pain is when a muscle is contracting or stretching
Second: Physiotherapy treatment is needed
Third: May require surgery and rehabilitation. 6-12 months to fully repair
Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)
NOT DUE TO LACTIC ACID
Microscopic tears within the muscle fibers
Usually caused when you begin a new workout routine or when you increase the duration or intensity
Peaks 1-3 days and disappears in 5-7 days
Tendonitis
Irritation of tendons due to overuse
Properly warming up and use of correct technique, and equipment can help avoid tendonitis

Chapter 6: Anatomy of the Skeletal Muscle and Role of the Nervous System

Skeletal muscles are made up of individual skeletal muscle fibers
These individual fibers are wrapped up in a sheath of connective tissue (perimysium)
These smaller bundles are further bundled together by a stronger sheath of tissue (epimysium)
The skeletal muscle will change its properties and become one with the tendon
The tendon attaches to the bone. This attachment occurs both at the muscle’s origin and insertion
Sarcolemma: A membrane that is beneath the epimysium that surrounds the muscle fibre and contains sarcoplasm
Sarcoplasm: The muscle cell’s cytoplasm that contains a higher concentration of calcium and mitochondria
Running along the length of the muscle fibers are myofibrils and myofibrils are made up of myofilaments
Within these myofibrils contain “thick” and “thin” filaments known as myosin and actin, respectively
Myosin and Actin are contained within repeating structural units called “Sarcomeres”
Myosin has a “head” and a “tail” like a golf club
The myosin “head” has an attachment site for actin, and actin has a binding site for the “head” of myosin
Actin has two proteins called: Troponin (binding site for Calcium) and Tropomyosin (covers the binding site on actin)

Chapter 6: Sliding Filament Theory

The myosin head does not attach to actin until calcium is released by the sarcoplasmic reticulum
Calcium binds with Troponin and Tropomyosin uncovers the binding site on actin so that the myosin head can bind to actin
ATP (energy molecule) comes and binds to the myosin head
ATP is broken down into ADP and P, which causes the myosin head to lock in place and bind to actin
This attach now forms the myosin cross bridges
ADP and P detach from the myosin “head”, and the myosin “head” slides producing a power stroke
The power stroke rotates the actin filament which causes the muscle to contract
The myosin head remains attached to the actin until a new ATP molecule binds to the myosin head
Contractions continue until the brain (or you) stops sending signals to make this muscle contraction
After you stop the activation, calcium will be removed from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and Troponin and Tropomyosin will cover the binding sites on the actin filament
When muscles contract, the actin and myosin filaments overlap to one another to cause the sarcomere to shorten
Muscles will shorten (contract) and move the object if the load is light
The muscle will stay the same if the load is equal to the muscle strength


Chapter 6: Types of Muscle Contraction
Concentric Contraction
Occurs when muscles fibers shorten
Ex. Biceps shorten when lifting an object
Eccentric Contraction
Occurs when the muscle fibers lengthen
Ex. Biceps lengthen as the object is place on the ground
Isometric Contraction
Occurs when the fibers do not change in length
Ex. Trying to lift an immovable object


Chapter 6: Neuromuscular Junction and Motor Unit

Neuromuscular System: Describes the link between the muscular system and nervous system
Neuromuscular junction
The point where the nerve cells and muscle cells meet to perform movements
There is a gap between the neuromuscular junction and the sarcolemma
The nerve cell releases a neurotransmitter called “acetylcholine”, which binds to the receptors of the muscle
When acetylcholine binds to the receptors, it causes sodium ions to be released which causes the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions

Motor Unit: refers to a neuron, its pathway (axon), and the muscle fibers it stimulates
Some motor units cause fine motor movements which stimulate a small number of muscle fibers
Ex. Holding a pencil, moving your eyes, etc.
Some motor units cause gross motor movements that engage hundreds of muscle fibers to perform large movements
Ex. Jumping, throwing, catching, etc.
Motor units comply with the All-or-none principle
All or None Principle: Motor units will contract to its fullest potential when stimulated
Ex. if a motor unit has 10 muscle fibers, either all 10 will contract when “turned on” by a stimulus, or none will contract

Chapter 6: Reflexes, Proprioception, and Movement

Reflexes: Automatic and rapid responses to a particular stimulus
2 Pairs of Reflex Types:
Cerebral Reflexes: slower compared to spinal cord reflexes because information is relayed to the brain
Spinal Reflexes: Faster compared to cerebral reflex because information only needs to be relayed to the spinal cord
Autonomic Reflexes: Reflexes that are controlled by the autonomic division of the nervous system and usually involve smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and glands
Ex. Digestion, salvation, sweating
Ex. Pupillary light reflex. Adjustments of the pupil size in response to changes in the amount of light
Somatic Reflexes: Reflexes that are controlled by skeletal muscles by the somatic division of the nervous system
Ex. Knee jerk
Ex. Withdrawal reflex, Hand on a hot Stove

There are 3 types of neurons in the human body
Sensory Neurons: Detect information from the outside world (i.e heat, light, sound, touch)
Motor Neurons: Sends signals away form the CNS and causes a response (i.e. moving a leg or arm)
Interneurons: Form interconnections between other neurons in CNS

Reflex Arc: A neural pathway in the body that rapidly responds to inputs from sensory neurons
The stimulus from the sensory neurons sends a signal to the CNS, but there is little or no interpretation of the signal
The signal is transmitted to the motor neurons which causes a response

5 Components of the Reflex Arc

The Receptor: Receives the stimulus
Sensory Neuron: Sends an afferent (incoming) impulse to the spinal cord or brain
Interneuron (Adjuster): Interprets the signal from the sensory neuron and issues a response
Motor Neuron: Comes an efferent (outgoing) impulse to the muscle or organ through the spinal cord
The Effector: The muscle or organ that carries out the response

Proprioceptors: Sensory receptors found in muscles, tendons, joints, and the inner ear that detect the motion of position of the entire body or a limb
Provide sensory information about muscle contraction, body position, posture, and balance
Proprioceptor system operates using the following two sensory receipts
A) Muscle Spindles: Help muscle atomically adjust to changing conditions by constantly sending impulse to the spinal cord
Intramural muscle fibres: specialized muscle fibres that have 2 afferent neurons and 1 efferent neuron connected to it so that when changes occur, signals are relayed from the muscle to the spinal cord and back to initiate a motor response
Ex. Contraction of weight bearing muscles when sudden weight is added
B) Golgi tendon organs (GTO): Sensory receptors that attach where tendons join to muscle fibres
When a muscle stretches the GTOs activate and send an impulse along an afferent neuron to the CNS
The CNS sends an efferent signal via neurons to the stretched muscle and causes it to relax so that injury can be avoided
The GTO acgts as a tension detection device for the muscle system to protect muscles from damage
To develop strength and power, the obstacles presented by the GTO need to be overcome but within reasonable amounts to avoid injury
Chapter 8: The Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems
The heart is made up of specialized tissue called cardiac muscle (myocardium)
Heart is divided into 2 sides
Right heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lung (pulmonary circulation). Dark red blood
Left heart pumps oxygenated blood to the rest of the body (systemic circulation). Bright red blood
Layers of the heart
Pericardium: Outer layer that is a tough protective sac that fits loosely over the heart
Epicardium: Sits below the pericardium
Myocardium: Sits below the epicardium
Endocardium: Tissue that lines the inside of the heart
The heart has special valves that prevent blood from flowing from the ventricels to the atria, known as AV valves
These valves are attached to the ventricle walls by special muscular extensions called papillary muscles and chordae tendineae

Cardiac muscle cells are interconnected and allow electrical signals to pass form cell to cell
Allows the myocardium to contract all at once so that blood is pumped
Sinoatrial Node (SA node): “Pacemaker”
Found in the wall of the right atrium and electrical signals are initiated here
The rate of contraction is controlled by the autonomic nervous system
Electrical signals pass through both atria through internodal pathways and cause the atria to contract from the top down to move blood to the ventricles
Atrioventricular Node (AV node):
Electrical signals to the AV node to signal the ventricles to contract from the bottom up, forcing the blood into the aorta and pulmonary arteries
SA node will cause the heart to contract 70-80 beats per minute
Electrical activity can be measured by an electrocardiogram (ECG), showing a graph representing the electrical events that happen in the heart

Chapter 8: Vascular System and Blood Flow

Blood vessels divided in to 4 categories:
Arteries:
Thick walls that carry blood away from the heart
Very elastic and can stretch and retract back to its original diameter
Absence of valves due to high pressure
Blood pressure is measured here
Systolic Blood Pressure: pressure caused by the contraction of the heart
Diastolic Blood Pressure: pressure caused by relaxation phase of the heart
Arterioles
Smaller than arteries and are important in blood distribution to different tissues in the body
Surrounded by rings of smooth muscles that constrict the arterioles to reduce blood flow ro relax to increase blood flow
These rings are controlled by the nervous system and chemical factors released to tissues
Example: During exercise, constriction (reduced blood flow) may go to the intestines, but relaxation (increased blood flow) would occur at the working muscles
Autoregulation: chemical factors that are made by skeletal muscles that diffuse to the arterioles and signal to relax so more blood will flow to working muscles. 

Capillaries:
Thin vessels that only allow 1 RBC through at a time, and are made up of very thin walls to allow diffusion of substances to occur easily
The smallest vessels in the body that plays the important role of exchanging gasses and nutrients with tissues
Venules and Veins: 
Venules are extensions of capillaries which form larger veins as they return to the heart; eventually forming the superior and inferior vena cava
Veins have valves that prevent back flow because pressure in veins is low compared to arteries.

Chapter 8: Returning Blood in Veins Back to the Heart

3 Main tools/Systmes:
Skeletal Muscle Pump: Skeletal muscles surrounding the veins contract to push/massage the blood back to the heart
Thoracic Pump: When a breath is taken, the pressure in the chest cavity is low, while the abdominal cavity is high. The pressure in the veins in the chest cavity drops, and the vein pressure in the abdominal cavity rises. The difference in pressure between the veins and the two cavities pushes the blood to the heart.
Nervous System: During exercise when cardiac output increases, the nervous system signals to the veins to slightly constrict which helps to return more blood back to the heart. 

Chapter 8: Blood and its Components

Blood is a specialized fluid that functions mainly as a transport medium for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nutrients
Blood is made up of 2 components
Plasma: 55% of blood
Mostly water with dissolved nutrients, proteins, ions, and gases
Blood Cells: 45% of blood
Red blood cells (erythrocytes) make up the most which ransport oxygen and carbon dioxide through the protein hemoglobin
White blood cells (leucocytes) make up less than 1% and play an key role in the immune system
Platelets (thrombocytes) are cell fragments that help control blood clotting

Chapter 8: Cardiovascular Dynamics

Deals with how the cardiovascular system adapts to demands and changing conditions
Factors that are considered when looking at cardiovascular dynamics
Cardiac Output (Q)
Blood Pressure
Distribution of Blood Flow


Chapter 8: Cardiac Output (Q)
The volume of blood the left ventricle pumps in 1 min. Measured in L/min
3 Factors that effect cardiac output
Activity:
Rest: 5-6 L/min, Heavy Exercise: >30L/min
Stroke Volume (SV): The amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle in a single contraction
Rest: 50%-60%, Max Exercise: 85%
Heart Rate (HR): The number of times the heart beats per minute

Chapter 8: Blood Pressure

Cardiac Cycle: The series of events that occurs through one heart beat
Relaxation (Diastole): The ventricle fills with blood
Contraction (Systole): The ventricle contracts and ejects the blood
Blood pressure is measured in milimetres of mercury (mmHg) and measures the force the blood exerts on the walls of the arteries and other blood vessels
Humans range from 90/60 mmHg to 120/80 mmHg
The changing pressure during the cardiac cycle is how blood is circulated throughout the body
Blood pressure is  effected by the type, duration, and intensity of the exercise
Systolic blood pressure is often proportional to exercise intensity; the greater the intensity the higher the pressure (ex. Endurance exercises)
Resistance Training causes short, but large increases to both systolic and diastolic pressure
After exercise, there is a period where blood pressure drops below normal resting values (post-exercise hypotension); even with low intensity exercises
Hypertension is when blood pressure is consistently elevated (>140/90 mmHg)
Considered modifiable since it can return back to normal with lifestyle changes
Risk Factors: obesity, smoking, aging, kidney diseases, and genetics

Chapter 8: Distribution of Blood Flow

During exercise, the dean for oxygen increases; especially in skeletal muscles
The cardiovascular system tries to meet these demands by increasing cardiac output and redistribution of blood flow
Less active organs will have reduced blood flow in order to supply more blood to the working/active organs
Increase: Active skeletal muscles
Decrease: Stomach, Intestine, and Kidneys
The only organ that is unaltered regardless of the intensity of exercise is the brain





Chapter 8: Respiratory System
Composed of structures that allow air to flow from the outside of the body to the lungs, and eventually gas exchange
3 Main Functions
Supply oxygen to the blood
Remove carbon dioxide from the blood
Regulate blood pH
External Respiration: The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the lungs
Internal Respiration: The exchange of gasses at the tissue level
Cellular Respiration: When cells use oxygen to make energy through different metabolic pathways
Can be split into two main structural zones:
Conductive Zone: Transports filtered air to the lungs
The air is at body temperature (37*C) when it reaches the respiratory zone which helps maintain body temperature and protect sensitive tissues
Hairs in the nasal cavity traps larger foreign substances and helps filter the air
Respiratory Zone: Where gas exchange happens
Composed of the alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs
The alveolar sacs are grape like structures that provide a large surface for diffusion of gasses into and out of the blood
The respiratory organs have a moist surface to make gasses easily dissolve and diffuse
Capillaries surround the alveolar sacs and are so thin that the distance for gas exchange is short
Minimal distance and large surface area helps to maximize the rate of gas exchange

Chapter 8: Gas Exchange and Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Transport

Diffusion: The movement of a gas, liquid, or solid from a place of high concentration to low concentration
Concentration Gradient: The diffusion in concentration
Factors affecting the rate of diffusion
Size of the concentration gradient
Increase in concentration gradient = greater rate of diffusion
Thickness of barrier
Distance between alveoli and capillaries is very small which optimizes the diffusion distance
Surface area
Large surface area allows for quicker exchange

Oxygen Transport (2 ways)
Plasma: Transports 2% of the oxygen in found in blood
Red blood cells: Through the protein hemoglobin, most of the oxygen is carried
Carbon Dioxide Transport (3 ways)
Plasma: Carries 5-10%
Red Blood Cells (2 ways)
Hemoglobin:
20% binds to hemoglobin and diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli and then exhaled
Bicarbonate System
70-75% diffuses into the red blood cells and undergoes a reaction with water to produce carbonic acid. 
Carbonic acid breaks down to hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion
Hydrogen ion binds to hemoglobin and bicarbonate ion diffuses into the plasma
When the blood arrives at the lungs, the process reverses and carbon dioxide is reformed, which diffuses out of the blood into the alveoli and then exhaled

Ventilation and Regulation of Blood pH
Blood pH measures how acidic or basic blood is. Blood normally has a pH around 7.4
During exercise, acids may be produced and released into the blood (decreasing the pH); which means more hydrogen ions are present
As ventilation increases, extra carbon dioxide is expelled, which causes more hydrogen ions to combine with bicarbonate ions to form carbonic acid
Carbonic acid eventually forms carbon dioxide and water which is exhaled. Thereby, bringing the blood pH back to around 7.4


Chapter 8: Respiratory Dynamics

During exercise, the body responds to the increased need for oxygen at the working muscles and tries to meet the demands through the following…
Pulmonary Ventilation (Ve): The exchange of air between the environment and the lungs (inhalation and exhalation)
Divided into 3 phases
VE rapidly increases at the beginning of the activity
Slower exponential increase compared to phase 1
VE levels off at a new steady level
***Determined by the intensity of the exercise and the fitness of the individual


External Respiration
External respiration is increased due to increase VE and blood flow to the lungs
Helps maintain normal concentration gradients to ensure gas exchange effectively oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide


Internal Respiration
Exchange of gasses at the tissues incerase to remove the increased carbon dioxide by-product, and supply the increased demand of oxygen in the cells to generate more ATP


Oxygen Cosumption (VO2): The amount of oxygen taken up and used by the body for metabolic processes
Calculated as the amount of oxygen inspired minus the amount of oxygen expired
The greater the workload, the greater the VO2


Maximal Rate of Oxygen Consumption (VO2max): The maximum of oxygen take in and used for ATP production during exercise
Measured using a computer system where an athlete performs incremental exercises to exhaustion (Ex. Treadmill with increasing resistance)
Measures aerobic fitness and aerobic exercise performance

Carbon Dioxide Production (VCO2): The amount of carbon dioxide produced and released due to metabolic processes
Calculated by measuring the difference between the amount of CO2 expired and the amount inspired
The ratio between VO2 and VCO2 helps calculate respiratory exchange ratio
This ratio tells us which metabolic system is being used in the working muscles
The amount of carbon dioxide made and oxygen used changes depending on the nutrient used to produce ATP
Fat: More oxygen is used compared to carbon dioxide
Carbohydrates: Less oxygen used compared to carbon dioxide

Limiting Factors of VO2max
Respiratory System: Inadequate ventilation and oxygen diffusion limitations
Cardiovascular System: Inadequate blood flow and/or cardiac output, or inadequate oxygen-carrying capacity (hemoglobin concentration)
Metabolic System: Lack of mitochondria
***Typically, healthy people are limited by the cardiovascular system where it is unable to meet the demands of the working muscles and deliver the needed amount of oxygen.

Rest-to-Exercise Transition
There is a “lag” between the start of exercise and reaching a “steady state”
By “steady state” we mean sub maximal exercise levels, where energy demands and energy production are balanced and can be sustained for an extended period of time.


This “lag” is called oxygen deficit when your working muscles sue metabolic processes that do not require oxygen until “steady state” is achieved
To reduce the “lag”, increase your aerobic capacity through aerobic training
