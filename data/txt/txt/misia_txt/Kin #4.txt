Unit #3 : Human Performance and Biomechanics 

Chapter 9: Change, growth, and development 

The human body goes through significant changes over a lifetime 
Studying how the human body grows helps us understand how people respond to exercise at different stages in development 
4 components of human growth and development 
Physical; growth and development of the body’s muscles, bones, energy systems, and nervous system 
Bodily changes occur in spurts of rapid change 
Cognitive: the ability to interpret and process information, and establishment of a person’s self-concept or self- awareness 
Capacity to perform complex intellectual tasks increases a bodies develop 
Social: development of relationships with peers, friends, adults 
Healthy relationships are fostered through opportunities for cooperation teamwork, and group problem solving 
Emotional: ability to manage and regulate emotions such as motivation, pleasure empathy, fear, and anger 
Tendency to develop greater self- awareness and enhanced ability to manage emotions, and greater empathy for others 
Each component takes on a unique characteristic at each stage of an individual's life 

Age and Physical Development 

3 types of age: 
Chronological age: 
Standard use of term “age” that measure in years, months, and days 
Skeletal age: 
Indicated by the physical maturity of the skeleton 
Developmental Age: 
Expressed in one’s ability to perform certain tasks and makes a rough comparison between a person’s chronological age and developmental age. 

Different rates of growth for different body parts 

Not all body parts and systems change at the same rate 
The human body develops according to 2 sequences: 
Cephalocaudal sequence: describes how growth progresses first in the head followed by the trunk, and the extremities 
Proximodistal sequence: describes how the body movements that occur close to the centre of the body develops first then those farther from the centre 
Example: 
Head develops the fastest -> centre of mass is higher -> instability 
i.e. babies typically crawl before they walk 
Larger muscles in the legs, arms, back, and neck develop -> centre of mass drops -> stability increases
Earlier: locomotor skills (running, jumping, hopping) vs. later: manipulation skills (dribbling, kicking, throwing) 

Neuroscience claimed the human brain was fixed and unchanging after its initial development 
Now, studies show the brain can be rewired and reshaped which is known as neuroplasticity 
Physical activity and enhanced cognition have been linked, where the hippocampus (associated with learning and memory) can grow. Leading to..
Increased levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); a substance needed for the growth of brain cells 
Stimulates the birth of new neurons 
The brain’s ability to change its neural pathways 
Prevents brain tissue loss in aging adults
Aerobic exercise helps children pay attention, plan, and resist, distraction 

Stages of social and emotional development and friendships 

Social and emotional development: the process where a person forms social and emotional bonds with others throughout life, while developing their distinct sense of self at the same time 
Positive and nurturing experiences and relationships help children develop socially and emotionally in a healthy way 
Importance of friendships
Benefits of friendships 
Helps create a sense of belonging and security and lessen stress
Practice skills essential to social, cognitive, communication, and emotional development 
Develop self-confidence and social skills 
Friendships provide a training ground for trying out different ways of relating to other people
Sport and physical activity can provide one of the best ways of establishing friendships
Develop and practice social skills and regulate emotions in different contexts
Helps foster the important concept of “shared responsibility” 
Where players work together as a team to achieve team goals and how individual actions impact the team 
Learning to sacrifice for the sake of the greater good of the team 
Learn to work with other adults who are not parents, which is a skill they will need to use on a regular basis later in life.

Motor learning model: 
Cognitive stage: 
Basic understanding of the task
Associative stage: 
Refine skills and develop awareness of the mistakes made; leading to improvement and less errors 
Autonomous stage: 
A skill becomes almost automatic where concentration is on highly refined aspect of the skill
Skills that are learned can be classified as…
Basic vs. advanced 
Distraction free environment vs constantly shifting contexts 

Phases of movement: every movement skill can be broken down into 3 main components 
Preparation phase: 
Body prepares to perform a skill in a way that it is intended to 
Execution phase: 
Generates momentum and requires the proper technique to execute the skill 
Applying the correct amount of force at the critical moment 
Follow-through phase: 
Body continues with the momentum that it is generated through the execution and slowly decelerates 
Important in force production and accuracy

Feedback to help one improve their skill requires the coach to understand the phases of movement for that movement skill 
Feedback can be categorized in 2 categories: 
Knowledge of performance feedback:
Based on technical performance 
Ex. bending arms when bumping 
Knowledge of result feedback: 
Based on the outcome of an action or sequence of events 
Ex: forcing a basketball player to go left instead of right 
Sport psychology: the study within the context of sport and how people feel, think, and behave in sporting situations, and what mental processes motivate the way they behave during training and competition 
Ideal performance state: the state of an athlete when they are in a “state of flow” 
Sense that their skills are equal to the challenge of the activity 
Action and awareness are aligned where movements are in tune with thoughts of the mind 
A lack of self-consciousness 
Transformation of time (where is speeds up or slows down) 
Psychological skills training: the interaction between sport and psychology where specific stratege=ies are used to improve athletic performance 
Methods include…
Self talk 
Self monologuing to urge yourself to achieve success 
Regulating this self- talk where positivity message are conveyed and fighting he discouraging 
Imagery/visualization 
Athletes visualize theme succeeding or recalling past triumphs as ways for improving performance 
Athletes attempt to engage their sense of touch, smell, and hearing to picture what success “feels” like 
Does not always have to be sport related
Ex. to remind calm, one might visualize themself in a quiet room. 
Relaxation/arousal regulation 
Anxiety inhibits performance by having an effect on the autonomic nervous system (muscle tension, breathing patterns. Heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature)
To regulate your mind and body to perform under optimal conditions psychologists emphasize techniques such as .. 
Breathing control and relaxation exercises
Meditation and imagery
Being aware of the body’s reaction to stress and how to control them improves overall performance 
Athletes use tools like brainwave activity to help them train to create brainwave patterns that are closer to the desired form. 
Improving motivation
Motivation can be classified as extrinsic (material rewards) and intrinsic (intangible) 
Motivation usually involves the following factors: 
Personal traits: the athlete’s particular environment/ background and personality 
Multiple motives: to gain financially, fame, please family or coach, etc. 
Staying motivated: changing environmental factors can keep the athlete engaged
Leadership: coaches who are able to instill loyalty and come with a personal style that resonates with athletes will move them to compete harder and “buy-in”
