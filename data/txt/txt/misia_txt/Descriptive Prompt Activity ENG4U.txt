PICTURE #1: Old Wife 

Aquamarine blue clear skies
Wispy clouds 
Glassy reflection puddle 
Sky blue fade into indigo fade into violet 
Rigid rocks 
When you walk the ground around you make droplet noises
Feel crisp air 12 degrees 
Eagles flying by 
Tall deformed rock statue 

PICTURE #2: Street Meat 

Six hotdogs 
Sitting on a bench 
Close up picture of food 
Smell of freshly sizzles sausages 
Most prominent hotdog is drizzles with barbeque sauce, mustard, and ketchup
Feel the sauce seeping into the bun
Ready to take a bite 
Bustling downtown atmosphere
Surrounding voices blending together 
Hot summer weather 
Body heat and hot meat amplifying the area 
Summer shorts, flip flops 
Ice cold drinks somewhere 
Thoughts of sipping amidst the weather 

PICTURE #3: Peggy’s Cove 
Landscape rocks 
Moss peeking out 
Prominent lighthouse 
Camouflage white 
Bold red 
Chunky base 
People walking, touring, taking pictures 
Misty clear sky, fade down to soft blue
Blank canvas, dipped in soft blue 
Piercing mute surroundings 
Damp atmosphere 
Slight dry 
Cold to the fingertips 
Slight wind 
Hear your feet crunch on small pebbles on your journey to the lighthouse 
Moss is wet and smaller pebbles and rock are dug beneath it

PICTURE #4: Campfire 

Flaming fire 
Blowing towards the top right 
Bold lemon yellow glowing with sunset orange 
Sunset orange projecting to the inner sides
Circular rock formation ash grey 
Firewood burning 
Marshmallow skewers peeking out in the bottom left edges 
Sounds of sizzling, like rapid keyboard clacking 
Frustrated fire wanting to escape 
Cold weather, somewhere within fall
Time of day is dusk, waiting for the black night 
Smell of burning firewood 
Radiating marshallow scent 

PICTURE #5: FIshing Dory 

Gorgeous blue teal boat 
Tip to the centre is rusted 
Tassled to blue teal rope on shore 
Rock is soaked wet 
Moist fog enveloping the air 
Bigger red boat in the distance 	
Peeking out from the curtain of fog 
Cold to the touch
Metal touch 
Once touched, wet that merges with your finger 
Rusted parts are decayed, also damp rigid texture, debris following your finger as you trace 
Taste of the sea
Cold fish smell 
Hear seagulls in the background trying to get your attention 
Freezy numb hands 
Soaked rock ground
Sound of crushing peanuts 
Static sound 
You are wearing gloves but the coldness still finds a way to grab you close 



PICTURE #6: Monarch butterfly 

Vibrant purple lustrife budded flowers 
Stem is fushia pink 
Comes in clusters as such 
Monarch butterfly
blood orange fades out to yellow orange down the bottom of the wings
Bold black boarders, dont want the colour escaping 
White specs like jewels, showcasing their delicacy 
Butterfly is nesting on flower, taking its nectar which the flower happy gives out like a best friend giving a gift
Blurry background of smooth rocks covering the entire floor
Peeking plants and greens 
Smell of sweet nectar, and lustrife 
In the background you smell clear grass, supporting character
Pops of colours within a world of dullness 
Call of spring 


PICTURE #7: The Catcher 

Upward angle facing down of kid smile 
Dusty old baseball helmet 
Overside to the kid, inner surface just barely hugging his face 
Navy blue textured protection vest, bigger than the kids entire torso
Kid is smiling; happy 
Sunshine peeking in, yet kid is in the shade
 Later afternoon, after a day of work 
Weather cooling down from the radiating run
Hear his breathe bouncing back on himself 
Sounds of laughter, feeling of happiness
Helmet dust imprints itself on you 


PICTURE #8: Dead Man’s Island 

Camp Mini-yo-we
Clearest blue sky 
Like tinted glass faded with frost at the bottom 
Sand under your toes
4 dark red canoes
Sound of them ever so slightly rocking form the shore hitting 
Glistening waves of the lake 
Calling out for you to touch its beautiful jewels
Look beyond the shore to see the waters gradually deepen 
Wanting for you to discover its mysteries 
Island just beyond the coast, guarded by tall evergreen trees, as if holding spears 
There must be history there 
Smell of sea salt 
Sound of seagulls landing on canoes
Bright fresh breeze 

PICTURE #9: Quebec City 

Brick wall building 
Vibrant colours 
Plants drapping down in front 
Wants to grab your attnetion to their beautiful hair 
Yellow door washed down
Maybe from rain
The amount of people it has met 
Stone door frame married with turned off lights 
Windows reflecting the world around them 
Top balcony painted bold dark blue 
Emphasize with pastel yellow 
Whitefences 
All lines so perfect yet so different 
Perfectly straight, yet perfectly imperfect towards each other 
Slanted balcony 
Slanted side walk it resides on 
How it wishes it was on straight ground 
Invites you in 
Feel the push of the door and a bell ringing 
3pm in the afternoon 
Going on a walk after late lunch 

PICTURE #10: Westakids Sunrise 

World is round; we are small 
Like looking through a glowing blue marble dipped in lava 
Engulfs you eyes – this is their world 
Drowsy kids, half asleep 
Motivation of the enviting glow 
Horizon of the sea is different than horizon of the groud 
Kids are covering the glistening sparkles the marble sky creates in reflection 
All kids, the ground are pitch black
They are not the focus. The sky is the main star. 
Air is touched with a chill, body heat is warm from sleep 
Scattered clouds wanting to try and steal the attention on the side 

Respiratory dynamics
During exercise, the body responds to the increased need for oxygen at the working muscles and tries to meet the demands through the following...
Pulmonary ventilation (Ve: the exchange of air between the environment and the lungs (inhalation and exhalation) 
Divided into 3 phases: 
1. VE rapidly increases at the beginning of the activity 
2. Slower exponential increase compared to phase 1 
3. VE levels off a new stead level 
External respiration: 
External respiration is increased due to increased VE and blood flow to te lungs 
Helps maintain normal concentration gradients to ensure gas exchange oxygenates the blood and removes carbon dioxide
Internal respiration:
Exchange of gases in the tissues increases to remove the increased carbon dioxide by-product and supply the increased demand of oxygen in the cells to generate more ATP 

Oxygen consumption (VO2): the amount of oxygen taken up and used by the body for metabolic processes 
Calculated as the amount of oxygen inspired minus the amount of oxygen expired
The greater the workload, the greater the VO2
Maximal rate of oxygen consumption (VO2max): the maximum of oxygen taken in and used for ATP production during exercise 
Measured using a computer system where an athlete performs incremental exercises to exhaustion (Ex. treadmill with increasing resistance) 
Measures aerobic fitness and aerobic exercise performance
Carbon dioxide production (VCO2): the amount of carbon dioxide produced and released due to metabolic processes 
Calculated by measuring the difference between the amount of CO2 expired and the amount inspired 
The ratio between VO2 and VCO2 helps calculate the respiratory exchange ratio 
This ratio tells us which metabolic system is being used in the working muscles 
The amount of carbon dioxide made and oxygen used changes depending on the nutrient used to produce ATP 
Fat: more oxygen is used compared to carbon dioxide 
Carbohydrates: less oxygen used  compared to carbon dioxide 

Limiting factors for VO2max 
Respiratory system: inadequate ventilation and oxygen diffusion limitations 
Cardiovascular system: inadequate blood flow and/or cardiac output, or inadequate oxygen-carrying capacity (hemoglobin concentration) 
Metabolic system: lack mitochondria 
** Typically, healthy people are limited by the cardiovascular system where it is unable to meet the demands of the working muscles and deliver the needed amount of oxygen 

The integration of cardiovascular and respiratory functions: 
Rest-to-exercise transition 
There is a “lag” between the start of the exercise and reaching a “steady state” 
By “steady state”, we mean sub-maximal exercise levels, where energy demands and energy production are balanced and can be sustained for an extended period of time 
This “lag” is called oxygen deficit when your working muscles use metabolic processes that do not require oxygen until “steady state” is achieved. 
The reduce the “lag”, increase your aerobic capacity through aerobic training
