					Perpetual Peace Short Essay 

	World War 1 was really a new development to the 20th century and mankind that destroyed nations and created many other disasters to come. This war resulted in over 67,000 deaths from Canadian soldiers, while in overall more than 40 million soldiers were killed entirely. “Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch” is a piece written by Immanuel Kant in 1795 which explained 6 key points that could have potentially prevented future conflicts from chaos, death, as well as attain world peace. World War 1, as well as any other horrible events later on could have been avoided if nations had followed Kant’s suggestions to having independent states unable to be under supremacy of another state in any way, standing armies to be abolished within due time, and having no nation have the authorization to gesture acts of hostility towards another in order to prevent skepticism.
Just like a person on its own, any state, let alone even a group of people, should not be permitted to become ‘property’ of another state under any circumstances. Not only does this directly oppose the initial law that no person should be able to lose their rights to themselves to someone else, but it is also seen as somewhat unfair when it comes to one nation being under control by another. This is for multiple reasons. If a state were to be under dominion of another, that would mean all forces within that state would have to appeal to the controlling state no matter what, even if it meant going against an individual state which they could have had connections to in the past. Maybe one of the main reasons this action had existed already is due to the fact that some nations wanted to expand their territory without going through any elongated processes which require any money expenses or risk of cutting off connections/ sister confederations. 
The nature of the war was to form new alliances with other states, as well as issues of nationalism, militarism, etc. In order to achieve victory in the end, it is very obvious that all nations participating would have to make sure their weapons, machines, and tools would be able to maintain and eventually surpass the power of other nations. As a result of this, competition arises from this and the equipment developed becomes more and more advanced, until eventually it becomes deadly enough to even wipe out all of humankind (to some extent of course). Examples of this could be nuclear bombs, machine guns, and grenades that could cause shell shock, etc. Kant briefly explains how it would be better if all “Standing armies shall in time be totally abolished”. The reason he says is because if all soldiers from all nations were eliminated completely, there would never be a development of war due to lack of standing forces, as well as no advancement in technology regarding weapons that could potentially act as a threat to beyond wars. 
Though wars are intended to have nations undermine each other through tactical weapons and such, there should never be a moment where there are any actions regarding hostility or deceit. This is because even if wars are very brutal and at times bloodthirsty, nations/states should be able to trust the words of each other in order to communicate well. If this does not happen, malicious acts may become a habit among them all such as betrayal, spies, dishonest orders/discussions. When deceptiveness is put into the battlefield of war, nothing good will ever come out of that and will only lead to increased death and unnecessary disaster.  These are the words in which Kant had expressed the issue, and despite this, it is evident that this had not been taken into consideration during World War 1. During this Great War, poison gas had been created/ introduced into the field by the Germans and had been thrown at the British forces, which had come to an obvious startle to them (Ypres 1915). This great disturbance caused over 6,000 casualties. If others had listened to Kant’s solicitation, so much deadly chaos could’ve been avoided, or even the possibility of no war at all.
