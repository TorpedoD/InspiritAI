Unit 2: Ideologies

Once we've gone through the slide presentation together, please write down whatever you know about the ideologies listed below:

Fascism: 
Classes in society that worship or look up to nationalism and militarism in their countries
Follows a pyramid like scheme for classes whereas the top is the class/person who holds the most power above all. (?)

Communism:
Somewhat the opposite of fascism, where having a class tier system is looked down upon, as all of society should be owned by the government and listen to everything they say without any protest 

Socialism: 
All property, buildings, etc, would be owned by the community in its entirety
Everything is split evenly, including resources and other expenses. 
Government runs and owns most of the property, but considers it shared with everyone

Isolationism: 
A government trying to separate its country away from all political issues, as well just anything relating to other nations
Trying to ‘isolate’ from the outer society in hopes of creating a new method of ‘government’
