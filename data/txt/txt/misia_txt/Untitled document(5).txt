Introduction 

	About 90% of all plant species are angiosperms, or flowering plants. They are unique as they can produce seeds inside of fruits, which has caught scientists' curiosity because of their intricacy and diversity. The split into monocots and dicots is a key distinction that has significant concepts for comprehending the wide range and development of plants. With an emphasis on features like the flower shape, its properties, and leaf traits, this study attempts to investigate the distinctions between these two groups in order to identify the elements that lead to the gigantic diversity found in the angiosperm kingdom.

Pre-lab Questions 

Microscopic characteristics that distinguish between a monocot and a dicot are: 
Monocots’ stems have vascular bundles scattered through the cross-section of the stem. Within the roots, they have a structure arranged in a ring on the sides of the stem.
Dicots’ stems will have a similar structure like the monocot roots; arranged in a ring structure. Its roots would be placed in a star shape in the centre. 

A monocot flower will have petals in multiples of 3, a parallel venation, and typically a fibrous root. A dicot flower will have petals in multiples of 4 or 5, have a pinnate venation, and is typically a taproot. 

It is important to wash your hands after completing an investigation because there are components and unknown substances within the sample object. By washing your hands, it gets rid of any potentially harmful chemicals/substances that would’ve remained on the hands that would be in danger of contaminating eyes, mouth, face, or ingestion. 


Procedure 

Monocots - White trillium, prairie lily, prairie crocus, blue flag iris, purple saxifrage, lady slipper

Dicots - Mayflower, wild rose, purple violet, dogwood tree, pitcher plant, fireweed, mountain avens 

(Dunlop et al., 2010)

Analyze and Interpret 

A distinction spotted in the external appearances was the leaf structure. Monocot leaves have a parallel venation with a smooth margin (sides), meanwhile dicot leaves have a pinnate venation with lobed, teeth-like sides. Another notable distinction was how the monocot flower petals and stamens came in multiples of 3, while dicots came in multiples of 4 or 5. 

The dicot class dominates the official list of floral emblems.

Conclusion 

This lab examined the unique characteristics of monocots and dicots, two important groups in the large family Angiospermae. The characteristics of monocots included smooth leaf margins, flowers with components organized in multiples of three, and fibrous root systems; they also had leaves with parallel venation patterns. Dicots, on the other hand, included flowers with parts in multiples of four or five, taproot systems, and leaves with lobed, teeth-like margins. This investigation of the various traits shared by these two groups deepens our understanding of the diversity and phylogeny of the plants in the angiosperm family.
