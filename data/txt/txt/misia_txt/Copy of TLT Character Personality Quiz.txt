TLT Character/Personality Quiz


Based on what we have learned about character development and analysis in children’s literature, create a Buzzfeed style quiz utilizing characters from The Lightning Thief (TLT). The quiz should demonstrate your understanding of the book and especially characters within the book. It should also be created with an interdisciplinary lens--drawing from multiple fields like literature (mythology), film, art, psychology, and pop culture (sociology). 

COMPONENTS
A Buzzfeed Style Quiz: In one GDoc, create a separate page for the quiz itself, one for rationale & paragraph, and one for results. Please use subheadings, so it is easy to distinguish among them.

Include at least one question from each field listed above: literature, film, art, psychology, pop culture.
Images for at least 2 questions

Rationale & research for each question: What discipline does your question draw from? How is it connected to TLT? Please include any links you used.
One paragraph reflection responding to the following questions: How is character development an interdisciplinary feat? How did you use an interdisciplinary lens in creating this product (quiz)? How does creating products like this help to promote children’s literature?
