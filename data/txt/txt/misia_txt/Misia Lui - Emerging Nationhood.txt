Item / Event: The King-Byng Affair

Historical Thinking Concept: Historical significance 

The King-Byng affair was fairly significant to Canadian history, as it really made people switch perspectives on how the governor general position was actually supposed to run correctly. WLMK (William Lyon Mackenzie King) who was Prime Minister at the time, was on the verge of a no confidence vote which would have a high chance to lead him to resign due to the fact that the progressives party withdrew their 22 seats, and that was the only thing supporting WLMK’s position as prime minister. Due to this, WLMK turned to Governor General Byng to ask him to basically call an election within parliament as an attempt to steer clear of a chance of a no-confidence vote. This attempt was quickly rejected, which led to WLMK’s resignation. Without any government now, Byng tried to run to the conservatives party to ask them to form a new government; this failed and resulted in a no-confidence vote. Now out of options, the Governor General had no other choice but to dissolve parliament and hold a vote, which was initially what WLMK wanted in the first place. WLMK won the position through election while making sure everyone knew that Byng had rejected this proposal before, and if he had not done that, a lot of conflict might have been avoided. 
This event has been recorded as a crisis within the parliament which has caught the attention of many now, and has also impacted following Governor Generals later on in their decision making.
