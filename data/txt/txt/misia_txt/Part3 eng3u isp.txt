			ENG3U- Independent Study Project: Part 3

Chosen format: Childrens’ Book
Name: The Little Sprout

My final product of my ISP is a children’s book surrounding the importance of acknowledging and appreciating growth as a small sprout that will later bloom into a rose. It begins with the Little Sprout feeling discouraged about how he looks different compared to his magnificent flower friends, so the other flowers try and cheer him up to make him shift his mindset to the actual journey of growing into the flower, which is where critical hope comes in. In a literal sense, critical hope can be represented within my children’s book from how sad and discouraged Little Sprout is from not being a pretty flower yet, and the power of language that flower friends Daisy and Sunflower portray quite literally result in the transformation of Little Sprout to his Rose form. This small children’s story can also relate to the book “The Fifth Season” by N.K Jemisin, as the main character in this novel is split into three parts which are shown as the three critical parts of her stages of life: a child, a young woman, and a middle aged mother. While watching this woman in each stage of her life, we can understand the change of perspectives and backgrounds that are included within her journey; this can be reflected back to “The Little Sprout” as his journey was to go through his life stages to the end while enjoying his time. When the Little Sprout is sad about not looking like all the other flowers, this can be related to how the main character in The Fifth Season also self isolated themselves due to her origins as an Orogene. The difference between The Fifth Season and The Little Sprout is that circumstances are completely different, but the core message of critical hope and using language to transform is present (even if it is also in different aspects).
