Senior School Student Council Letter of Recommendation


Hello Mr. Radder,

Misia Lui (10B) spoke with me and asked if I would be willing to write a letter of reference on her behalf since she is interested in running for the position of secretary on the Student Council.

I had the absolute joy of teaching Misia 3 years in a row in the Middle School. Besides teaching her, we often enjoyed conversations outside of the classroom. We also have enjoyed chats since she entered the Senior School last year. Therefore, I can assure you that I know her quite well and I wholeheartedly endorse her to run for the position of secretary. 

As we all know, these past 3 years of pandemic school life have limited the leadership opportunities in the school. However, I can certainly speak to how responsible she was as a student. Misia was a hard working student who could always be expected to complete any work that was assigned to her. To put it simply, Misia always understands her responsibilities and she carries them out very well.

Misia has always been a loyal friend and she understands how important it is to care about everyone she comes into contact with. I have seen her in many different situations and she is attentive and devoted to people. She shows great respect for everyone and she especially respects her teachers and desires to honour them.
I could say a lot more, but let me end with this. Misia is a very positive young lady who enjoys life and I know that she would definitely bring a lot of positive energy and ideas to the student council if she has the opportunity to work with others in this way.

Sincerely, 

Dean Westacott, Middle School teacher
