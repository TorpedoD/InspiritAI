Know What You Believe Chapter Three Study Questions
Created by Dr. Alexander Philip

Read chapter three of Know What You Believe and then answer the following questions. 
1. List and explain four ways in which Jesus proved that he is fully God.(4) 
“The Word was God” John 1:1 
“Our great God and Saviour, Jesus Christ”  Titus 2:13
“The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” John 1:14
“His Song Jesus Christ … the true God and eternal life.” 1 John 5:20
2. What evidence is there that Jesus is fully human? (1) 
Jesus is fully human, and we know that because if he wasn’t fully human, he wouldn’t be able to die for us on the cross. Though a miracle, Jesus was born through a human mother, therefore is born fully human, and throughout his life had experienced all the hardships every human has gone through. He might have been sent from God, but throughout his time on Earth, he was human; only when he died his spirit returned to heaven.
3. The central event of the Christian faith is the death and bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Provide three specific lines of evidence to demonstrate that Jesus’ resurrection from the dead is fact not fiction. (3x2=6)
 a.  The empty tomb
b. The revolutionized ives of the disciples
 c. The Lord’s day
 4. Now that Jesus has resurrected from the dead and has ascended to heaven, what is Jesus doing? (2)
Jesus is now seated at the right hand of the Father of heaven, “far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every title that can be given”.
