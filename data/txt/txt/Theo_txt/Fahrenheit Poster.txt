This poster aims to present two topics: war in Fahrenheit 451 and the broken relationship between a husband and wife. 

Mrs. Phelps states, "He'll be back next week. The Army said so. Quick war. Forty-eight hours they said, and everyone home. That's what the Army said" (90). I'm not worried...I'll let Pete do all the worrying" (91). 

Throughout the novel, it is clear that there is an ongoing war. However, the citizens are desensitized and distracted by things like the parlour wall. Even Faber and Montag only notice it after a period of time. Bradbury writes, “A bomber fight had been moving east all the time they talked, and only now did the two men stop and listen, feeling the great jet sound tremble inside themselves” (83). People are desensitized to death and war. Perhaps, it is because they always see it in film. This is connected even to our modern society. War is something that may be talked about at the dinner table. Someone may offer a couple of words of sympathy, but rarely ever is any action taken. The other key idea is that thought there is a horrible war happening, no one seems to notice. People are unaware of the things happening above them.

There is no love between a husband and wife in Montag’s society. Mrs. Phelps does not truly care or love her husband. For Mrs. Phelps, if her husband dies, she will just get married again. Mildred even talks about a five-minute romance. Montag and Mildred even forgot how and where they met. There is not relationship or love. 

P.S. The comma between ‘Wives’ and ‘Don’t’ was purposely left out.
