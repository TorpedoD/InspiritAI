Unit 1

1.1
Scalar: quantity with only magnitude (15 km)
Vector: quantity that has magnitude and direction (15 km [S])
Vector scale diagrams (arrow = direction, length = magnitude)

Distance (  ): the total length of the path traveled by an object.
Position (  ): the distance and direction of an object from a particular reference point. 
Displacement (   ): the change in position of an object, or a vector quantity that points from an initial position to final position. 

1.3
Acceleration: a vector quantity that describes the rate of change of velocity; either a change in speed or a change in direction. 
You can have -ve acceleration when the object is speeding up. 

1.3 (II)
Displacement in a V(t) graph is the area in a V(t) graph. 
Average vs. instantaneous velocity. 
Can determine average velocity by calculating the slope of a secant line on a displacement-time graph. 

1.4
The area under an acceleration-time graph represents the change in velocity.
