Body Structure: Peziza have a cup-shaped fruiting body, which is known as the ascocarp. A thick network of hyphae make up the mycelium.  The hyphae is not visible above ground but forms a complex and dense network within the substratum (eg. rotting log) that the fungus grows on. 

Reproduction:  Peziza can asexually and sexually reproduce. For asexual reproduction,  conidial spores or chlamydospores, which are thick walled cells, germinate, and if successful, grow a new mycelium. In sexual reproduction, the cell goes through meiosis and mitosis. 

Feeding: Peziza feed by decomposing dead organic matter. Because they act as decomposers, they also perform an ecological role by recycling nutrients. 

Interesting Facts: Peziza are commonly known as cup fungi. They are also mostly perennial in nature.

















Body Structure: The bleeding heart can grow up to 3 ft. tall and 4 ft. wide. It has green leaves which divide into 3 leaflets and heart-shaped flowers that have 2 pink petals on the outside and 2 white petals on the inside. The flowers dangle in a row on an arch-shaped stem. 

Feeding: Like most other plants, the leaves gather sunlight to photosynthesize to make energy. The roots take in nutrients from the soil and water. 

Life Cycle: The bleeding heart begins to grow in early spring and blooms in late spring. Its foliage withers midsummer. It is a perennial flower.

Interesting Facts: The bleeding heart is native to east Asia (China, Japan, and Korea). It was brought to England in 1810. It grows best in light shade.

































Body Structure: The ostrich fern has green fronds that can grow up to 2 meters long. The fronds are widest at the middle and narrow at the tip. The rootstock is vertical. The veins are not forked but straight. 

Reproduction: Spores develop on fertile fronds. The gametophyte, also known as the prothallus, produces antheridia and archegonia. The sperm swims to the egg via a drop of water and fertilizes the egg, which grows into a sporophyte.

Life Cycle: Spores are released in early spring. The ostrich fern emerges in early spring and has white hairs that disappear as it grows. In the autumn, the fertile fronds develop, and they persist through the winter. 

Interesting Facts: Fiddleheads from the ostrich fern are edible but must be cooked. They were first eaten by the Native Americans.

Body Structure: The white-lipped snail has a height of 15-16 mm and a width of 16-22 mm. The shell is glossy, smooth and typically yellow with dark bands. It is distinguished by the white lip around the shell opening. The body of the snail is greenish-gray. 

Feeding: The white-lipped snail is a primary consumer. It eats ragwort, nettles, and hogwarts. 

Reproduction: The white-lipped snail is able to self-fertilize because they have both male and female reproductive parts. However, they still must mate. To do this, one snail pierces the other snail’s skin with calcium carbonate.

Interesting Facts: In some parts of the world, snail eggs are eaten as ‘snail caviar.’ The white lip of the shell can be broken off, which makes them hard to identify. 




























Body Structure: Poodles have a thick, curly, and non-shedding coat. Their ears are long and set close to the head. Poodles come in 3 different sizes: Toy, Miniature, and Standard. The Toy Poodle is the smallest of the three and averages a height of under 11 inches.

Reproduction: Poodles reproduce sexually. After poodles mate, the sperm from the male poodle can fertilize the egg of a female poodle, which can develop into an offspring. 

Life Cycle: Poodles are placental mammals, meaning offspring are carried in the mother’s uterus until they are born. After they are born, they are expected to have a life expectancy of around 12 years. 

Interesting Facts: The poodle originated in Germany. Its distinctive trim historically originated to improve its efficiency in water.
