NAME OF CLUB/ORGANIZATION: Mahjong Club

VISION/PURPOSE STATEMENT
Please provide a description of your club (in two paragraphs maximum).

The PCA Mahjong Club is a diverse and inclusive community open to all students from grades 9 to 12. This club allows students to build long-lasting relationships through a social game and engage in strategic thinking. Mahjong provides a strong contrast to the digital and technological addictions that are adversely affecting modern society. Mahjong is an exciting game that involves careful observations and meticulous decisions. Mahjong is a game that was played by many older generations; thus, the PCA Mahjong Club provides a connection between students and their parents and grandparents and even to their ancestors. Mahjong serves not only as a game, but as a skill that can open up many opportunities for PCA students to connect and build relationships with elderly individuals. For example, many elders in old-age homes are lonely and neglected by their families. Mahjong acts as a portal that opens up the opportunity for students to be able to converse with elderly individuals, which acts as a foundation that can develop into a personal relationship. 


CONTRIBUTION TO PCA STUDENT LIFE
Please provide a detailed explanation about how this club will positively impact the PCA student community (in two paragraphs maximum).

Mahjong has historically been associated with gambling, debt, and crime. However, the intrinsic nature of mahjong is this: a game that builds community. PCA’s theme this year is unity. I believe that mahjong club is one of the many limbs of the body that will play a part in building PCA’s community. Mahjong is purely a social game that encourages students to think, grow, and improve. It is a contrast to modern society’s addiction to phones. Furthermore, Mahjong Club allows students to converse with other students they may not usually converse with. The PCA Mahjong Club is a community of love, laughter, and livelihood. 

ORGANIZATION AND PLAN 
Outline how club meetings will be organized. Provide a sample schedule for one meeting.

Players will play until an individual wins. Players will be rotated, so that all students will have the chance to play with each other. There will be a tournament(s). At 12:15, students will clean up.
