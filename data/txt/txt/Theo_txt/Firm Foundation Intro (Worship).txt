The next song we will be singing is Firm Foundation. In the first verse, it says, “Christ is my firm foundation, the rock on which I stand.” This reminded me of Matthew chapter 7, where Jesus talks about a wise man building his house on the rock – rain and wind blew, but his house remained. So, when trials come our way, if Christ is our rock, we do not have to worry. As we sing this song, let’s reflect on where our foundation is built and examine whether our foundation is built on Christ or perhaps something else in the world.
