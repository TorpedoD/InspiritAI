Theodore Chiu: Questioner										25/9/23





Study history to learn. Darwinâ€™s evolutionary theory relates to the change of the natural environment. Indigenous injustice was not caused by natural environmental change, but it was people who changed the environment. Indigenous were not able to adapt. What is the main message/what do we learn of Seven Fallen Feathers?

The issues Tagala is writing about are still existing today, whether it is poor education systems or children on substance abuse. After reading and learning about these, what can we do?

What was the goal of residential schools? Was it accomplished? What was the outcome?

How do we apply what we have learned into our daily lives?
