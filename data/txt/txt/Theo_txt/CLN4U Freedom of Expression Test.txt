CLN4U Freedom of Expression Test
Theodore Chiu

In the Irwin Toy test, the court must first determine whether the case even involves freedom of expression. Anything that conveys meaning or has content falls under this umbrella. A person writing about his personal feelings regarding a certain race, a man standing in the middle of the road, or someone watching pornography are all examples of expression. It is also important to note there is no distinction between form and expression or activity and expression. So, protesting would still be an example of expression, as well as French only signs. This first part must pass in order to move on. Next, the court must determine whether the government had a restrictive purpose. Is the government restricting a single meaning? Are they restricting a form of content to decrease the access? In the Irwin Toy case, advertisements for children’s products were the meaning that was being singled out, and the prohibition of these advertisements in children’s advertisements was the form. If the government merely restricts the physical consequences, like littering, then it does not pass this section. However, there is one more step. If the government did not have a restrictive purpose but still a restrictive effect, then it passes the test. It is considered to have a restrictive effect if it withholds a person from truth seeking, participating in societal/democratic issues, and seeking individual fulfilment. For example, if someone wrote a paragraph regarding how he hated LGBTQ+ people and the laws regarding this group, his lawyer could argue that his individual fulfilment and ability to participate in societal issues were restricted. It does not need to pass both restrictive purpose and effect to move on to the Oakes test; it only needs to pass one. Lastly, the government applies a more ‘loose’ Oakes test to policy framework and commercial expression. 
Butler defines the constitutional limit on what obscenity Parliament can ban. Parliament can ban the distribution of violent and child porn. The rule is: what the community would tolerate on the basis of the degree of harm one would be exposed to. Usually, a jury represents the community, but sometimes it can be a judge. Either way, there is no direct fine line of what is tolerated, but it is based on what the community would tolerate. The degree of harm is related to the likelihood of the viewer of that certain porn would take in those values and act in that manner. For example, if someone were to watch a video of a woman being raped and not treated with equality, would the viewer adopt those ideas and act in anti-social manners or become a rapist? The degree of harm is based on Charter rights. For example, the mistreatment of women in pornographic videos is not allowed because it goes against equality and discrimination rights. There is also an artistic defence. If the prohibited pornography is not the main theme, but serves a greater artistic, literary, or other theme, then it is permitted. So, if a book were about the effects of rape, but decribes the rape the women went through, it would be permitted. 
In Whatcott, hate speech is anything – from an objective reasonable person’s point of view – that would likely expose a person or persons to detestation and vilification on the prohibited grounds of discrimination. Hate speech is not decided by the plaintiff or defendant. It is from the view of a reasonable, unbiased person. This reasonable person decides whether something is ‘likely to expose.’ Detestation and vilification is beyond mere dislike or disdain. It is extreme enmity and ill-will. It is blaming certain groups for problems in society. It is relating certain groups to already vilified groups in society, like paedophiles, murderers, or rapists. Lastly, the reasonable person is not focused on whether what the author said will hurt the person who heard/saw it, but the reasonable person decides whether the ‘listener’ will be influenced and act on what they heard to attack the certain group.  Its purpose is not to prevent hurt feelings, humiliation, belittlement, or offensiveness, as was the case in Keegstra, but the purpose is to prevent societal discord and discrimination. 

The attached flyer is not a form of hate speech because the reasonable person would not find that the content of the flyer would lead gays and lesbians to be exposed to vilification and detestation. One could argue that associating homosexuals with Sodomites is vilifying homosexuals because Sodomites are an established group of ‘villains.’ However this is not the case. Yes, the Sodomites were sinners, but they were known to participate in homosexual activity. He is comparing the two groups due to the activity they are participating in. Furthermore, the Sodomites are not a group that society as a whole views as villains. On the other hand, paedophiles and rapists are groups that are universally seen as villains. Those who indulge in homosexuality may even praise the Sodomites for their progressiveness! People may also argue that when Whatcott writes, “homosexual sex is about risky and addictive behaviour” he is expressing hate. However, he later provides statistics that homosexuals are 430x more likely to lead to Aids. Whattcott is merely expressing his religion, morals, and concern for society. Furthermore, this article would not make someone have extreme enmity and ill-will towards homosexuals, but instead a stronger feeling of pity and an urge to help homosexuals. He does not write about how all homosexuals should be killed or put in prison. He has extreme hate towards the act of homosexuality, but not the people. He mentions how the Sodomites were redeemed; Whatcott does not want the homosexuals to die, but he wants them to be redeemed and avoid “God’s wrath.” Furthermore, he writes, “But there is still hope….thousands of sodomites and lesbians find redemption and healing through the grace and mercy that is found by turning to Jesus Christ the Lord and giver of life” (para. 3). It is clear that Whatcott has a care for society. He is concerned with “the early death and morbidity of many children” (para. 3). After reading this, a person would not want to attack homosexuals but help sodomites and lesbians find redemption and healing through Christ. Whattcott is providing statistics (though they may be incorrect) as well as connections back in history, so that people will be aware of history, to not repeat it. The only issue in this paragraph is: “Sodomites are… 3 times more likely to sexually abuse children.” Here, Whatcott, is presenting a statistic that is blown out of proportion where he vilifies homosexuals as child abusers. This part should be striked out. Otherwise, the rest is not hate speech. 
Is the government justified in banning obscenity under the Butler definition?
The government is justified in banning obscenity under the Butler definition. The Community Standards test, with the evaluation of the degree of harm, indirectly reflects the community’s morals as well as provides an objective bottom line regarding the degree of harm done. If the government just went with whether the community thought the content was tolerable, then a community could have a rapid decline of morals and it would be purely subjective. What if suddenly the community thought the rape was acceptable? The community would be filled with chaos. Someone could reason that any obscenity 50 years ago would not have been approved. Some obscenity is allowed today. In 50 years, violent porn will be allowed! Yet, this is a slippery slope. However, if the court only measured the degree of harm done, then a strange contention would arise. We know that alcohol is bad for the body. It is scientifically proven that eating a lot of sugar is bad, too. Then, why are there no regulations to prevent these harms? People can eat as much sugar and drink as much alcohol as they want. What is different about pornography? Furthermore, the effects of viewing the content are ‘potential.’  One could argue that the effects are larger. It is because of an underlying bottom line of morals the government recognizes. It is undeniable that morals exist in society. Society as a whole shares a ‘bottom line.’ For example, asides from a small fraction of amoral individuals, people would agree that rape and child sacrifice and murder are wrong. One could reason that the ancient Aztecs did child sacrifice, so how do we know that in 50 years, we won’t be doing the same. In response, the law is made for the present and is made to reflect the beliefs in the society. The government is essentially disguising morals in the form of harm prevention. The government should enforce morality or else there would just be chaos. The more violent porn and rape a person sees, the more they will normalize it. The law should act as a standard so that people do not drift to be desensitised and amoral.

Furthermore, pornography is a form of expression that is not intrinsically valuable. It can be used to display a greater artistic value, but in itself, it is purely instrumental for individual fulfilment that often leads to addiction. There are many cases of pornography addicts. People have the choice to view regular porn, like they would to buy alcohol from the liquor store. However, there is an age restriction in alcohol. A restriction in pornography is the same concept. There is no truth seeking in pornography, like a movie about gender equality would have. Not many people would say violent porn is on the same basis and value with gender rights.  Thus, the Community Standards test is a reasonable method in banning obscenity.
