Censorship Response Questions
	Censorship is the prohibition of ideas or beliefs. It is withholding a certain ideology from the public, often to promote a contrary worldview. Censorship is not about banning the medium of content, like books themselves, but it is about restricting the ideas and beliefs found within the medium. Furthermore, censorship is not purely about forbidding an action, such as banning the use of threatening language, but it focuses on the reason behind the action. For example, removing foul language in a children’s television show is not purely about the act of swearing, but it is about the belief that children should not be swearing, and even more so, that foul language is not a promoted virtue.
	There are many positive uses of censorship, such as prohibiting violence in shows geared towards children. However, censorship and danger go hand in hand. Although there is an absolute truth, all people share different perspectives on what is considered to be true. So, if there is a central authority that has the power to censor whatever it likes, not only will some people’s view on certain beliefs be prohibited, but there is the possibility of common people being unable to discover absolute truth.  Additionally, the prohibition of ideas found in books or film will cause a society to decline in certain areas of knowledge. If books written on Jesus Christ were banned, then where would people get information regarding this topic? Disregarding natural revelation, people would slowly not know Christ, and within fifty years, perhaps only a few people would even know the name Jesus. The same is with other topics like science. Thus, the greatest danger of censorship is its ability to cause a society to stray away from the truth.
