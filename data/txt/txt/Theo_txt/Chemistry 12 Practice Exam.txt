UNIT 1
Short Answer:

In an endothermic reaction, do the reactants or products have more potential energy?

What is activation energy? 


Does a high activation energy mean a process will be fast or slow in a reaction at room temperature?

How does a catalyst increase the rate of reaction? 


This results in more reactants having an _________ that is equal or greater than the activation energy. 

Does a catalyst affect enthalpy. Why or why not?


Is the activation energy for the rate-determining step higher in comparison to the other steps.
