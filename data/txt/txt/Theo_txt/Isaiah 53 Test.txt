How would you convince a Jew to put more emphasis on Isaiah 53?

	There is not much value that Judaism places on the New Testament; however, the 39 books in the Tanakh/Written Torah are still the Word of God. Yeshayah (Isaiah) is a major prophet from God. All of God’s Word is important for living, not just certain parts. If we picked and choosed what parts of the Bible we like, we’d essentially be acting like God. We cannot serve 2 masters. Serving a master half-heartedly is like serving 2 masters. We would merely be following God in the parts that seemed easy. Therefore, we must place importance, truth, and application with all of God’s Word. 
	It is evident that you believe in sin, so if there is no coming Messiah, how is your sin dealt with? You believe that God is just. Therefore, He cannot magically erase your sin. You are no longer offering animal sacrifices. And even if you were, those are only temporary. How can an animal represent man? Thus, Isaiah 53, which talks about a man coming to bear our iniquities, how can Jews ignore it? Is it not God’s Word? Is it not of vital importance? How else can you be saved?

How does Isaiah 53 connect to the prophecies?

Prophecies talk about how the whole world will be blessed → Isaiah punishment that brings peace, we are healed, laid on Him the iniquity of us all, justify many, made intercession for the transgressors.
Prophecies say how He will be man → Isaiah talks about growing up and then being cut off from the land of the living (life/ growth and death, which are connected to man). 
Prophecies talk about how the Messiah will crush the serpent's head → Isaiah talks about the arm of the Lord (is this something a mere man can do?)
Immanuel → God is clearly with his people in Isaiah 53 and has not forgotten nor forsaken them. 


Why may there not be much emphasis on Isaiah 53 (not believe in Jesus)?

The Pharisees were ‘in charge’ of educating people on the Scriptures. They did not like Jesus. It also put their position and power in jeopardy. In order to control and keep Jewish people in obedience towards the Pharisees, they may have put less emphasis on an coming Messiah, which continued to remain in Judaism today.
There was a low level of literacy in the Jewish people. So, the Pharisees had a lot of control over what Scripture was being read. 
The prophets usually did not come with good news. It was usually about God coming to punish the people if they did not repent. They did not receive much traction.
