This webpage provides an overview of GM foods and the two methods used to transfer DNA. The Royal Society is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence and is a Fellowship of many eminent scientists. This resource was used for the “Introduction” of GM foods and the two methods that DNA material is transferred.











GM: organisms in which genetic material has been altered unnaturally. 
4 broad steps of GM.
How is it done?
Corn:
Identify: trait they want the corn to have (drought, herbicides, insect repellant). Find organism with that trait. They found soil bacterium called bacillus thuringiensis, which produces a natural insecticide. 
Copy: that gene in the Bt.
Insert: insert DNA into the corn plant. Now corn has this new trait. 
Grow: plant.

How is it transferred?
2 methods: 
Particle gun: coat the surface of small metal particles with the relevant DNA fragment and bombard the particles into the plant cell. 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens: use bacterium or virus that naturally transfers DNA into a host cell as part of their normal life cycle. Gene of interest is transferred into the bacterium which naturally transfers it into the genome of a plant cell. 

Agrobacterium: rare occasions this happened naturally. For example, sweet potatoes contain DNA sequence that was transferred thousands of years ago from agrobacterium. 

Common GM foods:
Cor, soy, canola, white sugar beet, and alfalfa grown in Canada. 
Salmon GM to reach important growth point faster. 
Lots of animals eat GM groups. Studies have shown that there is no difference in how GMO and non GMO food affect health and safety of animals. Animals that eats GMO does not turn into the GMO. Logically, if it did, an animals would have the DNA of any food it eat. 
Organic - nonGM.
Both sides: Focus on bold points. 

For: golden rice: increase in vitamin A and iron. Nutrient content increase. 

For: decrease pesticide use. Reality is opposite. Glyphosate is is a herbicide. Hawaii hosts many open-air fields of experimental genetically engineered crops. Because there is so much testing, high volumes of toxic pesticides are very easily spread. Open fields and pesticides catch in the wind. Chart shows increase of 234% since GM crops introduced in 1994 to 2020.  More on societal issues. 

Leads to idea of superbugs and superweeds. Weeds and bugs that are resistant to pesticides and herbicides require stronger pesticides and herbicides. March 2010, Monsanto, company who is large player in GM foods, admitted that insects have developed resistance to their Bt (insect resistant) cotton crop. God made insects ability to adapt. 

Allergies and Cancer: Government of Canada vs. functional medicine distinctives: safety assessment, no evidence cause allergies and cancer. Says that toxic and allergenic compound are not transferred along with the desired characteristic when new DNA is introduced. And does not increases the level of allergenic compounds or anti-nutrients. 
Body does not recognize it necessarily as food and can get confused and not absorb or break it down properly. When gets into bloodstream, does not recognize what it is and attacks it. For example, if in the gut lining, attacks own gut. IBD (irritable bowel disease). Ppl. with soy allergies in US and UK increased by 50% after GE soybean was introduced. Lab animals were fed GM foods. Evidence that showed it harmed intestinal tract. Leaky gut syndrome when the intestinal lining grows inflamed, damaging microvilli, meaning essentially nutrients cannot be absorbed. Digestive issues.

Outcrossing: when GM plants and ‘organic’ plants mix. GM crops intended for animals mixed with human food. GM crops invading/ ‘taking over’  natural species. Farm GM and Farm non GM will result in Farm GM.  
Patents: on genetic sequence mean that corporations can own seeds. Monsants was the largest seed company in the world, owned 86%, until bought by Bayer in 2018. Dominate seed market and pesticides. 

Farmers: Bowman vs. Monsanto: farmers cannot replant patented genetically engineered seed. Farmers have to pay companies like Bayer, each growing season to use seeds. Farmers have to sign “Technology Use Agreement”, a contract with Monsanto whereby farmers agree not to save seeds for planting again. Company (grow so much more and faster) gain, farmers suffer. 

Safe? Gov. of Cad. says okay. Research shows GMF does not cause cancer. Done on rats. WHO: No allergic effects have been found. Ultimately long term effects unknown. No evidence just means they haven’t found any.  
Restaurants hard to avoid and in grocery stores. 

Christian view that humans are playing Creator.  God made the world perfect, and yes there is sin. But some may argue that we’re changing the fundamental building blocks of life.

Genetic modification (GM) is a term commonly used for genetic engineering or GE – it is the introduction of new characteristics to an organism by making changes directly to its genetic makeup, e.g. DNA, through intervention at the molecular level.

Scientists can change the traits of organisms by inserting pieces of DNA, whole genes, or long stretches of assembled DNA segments originating from different sources. The inserted genetic material is often derived from unrelated species, but it can also be taken from the same or a closely related species, or be newly made up. Scientists can also change traits by disrupting genes, deleting or swapping small DNA segments, or introducing genetic material to silence genes.
There is some GM salmon sold in Canada and five GM crops are grown in Canada: corn, soy, canola, white sugar beet and a small amount of alfalfa.  Also, GM cotton (cottonseed oil) and some papaya and a few types of squash are grown in the U.S. and can be imported into Canada. GM apples and potatoes could soon be sold as food in Canada. 
Patents on genetic sequences mean that corporations can own seeds, and the use of patented genetically modified traits has helped facilitate corporate consolidation in the seed market. Monsanto was the largest seed company in the world and owned about 86% of GM seeds sown globally but, in 2018, Monsanto was bought by Bayer, the second largest agrochemical company in the world. Bayer is one of the top four companies that dominate the global commercial seed market, and the pesticides market. 
Yes it is! Organic farmers reject the use of GMOs as well as synthetic pesticides, and they embrace many other important ecological and animal welfare practices. The national Canada Organic standard prohibits the use of genetically engineered (genetically modified or GM) seeds and other GM products, and it also prohibits the use of synthetic pesticides (herbicides, insecticides and fungicides etc). Organic farmers provide non-GM food.

GMOs are organisms (like plants, animals or microorganisms) whose genetic material (DNA) has been changed. 
GMOs have their genetic material changed for different reasons:
to introduce a desirable characteristic (for example: making crops resistant against certain plant diseases)
to remove an undesirable characteristic (for example: to prevent browning in apples)
to enhance a desirable characteristic that occurs naturally
It is not mandatory for GM foods to be labelled in Canada as they have been found to be as safe and nutritious as non-GMO foods.
Labelling of GM foods is challenging. This is because GM foods like sugar, canola and corn are widespread in our food supply. For example, GM corn can be used to make high fructose corn syrup which is used as an ingredient in many other foods (like cereal, yogurt, pop, frozen entrees, salad dressings and condiments). As a result, all of these foods would need to be labelled as having GM ingredients.

What about animals that eat food made from GMO crops?
More than 95% of animals used for meat and dairy in the United States eat GMO crops. Independent studies show that there is no difference in how GMO and non-GMO foods affect the health and safety of animals. The DNA in the GMO food does not transfer to the animal that eats it. This means that animals that eat GMO food do not turn into GMOs. If it did, an animal would have the DNA of any food it ate, GMO or not. In other words, cows do not become the grass they eat and chickens don’t become the corn they eat.
The AquAdvantage Salmon has been genetically modified to reach an important growth point faster. FDA has also approved an alteration in the GalSafe pig for human food consumption and potential therapeutic uses. The GalSafe pig was developed to be free of detectable alpha-gal sugar on its cell surfaces. People with Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS) may have allergic reactions to alpha-gal sugar found in red meat

the microbiological and chemical safety of the food
the potential of the GM food to cause allergic reactions
the potential for introducing new toxins into the GM food
how the GM food was developed, including any genetic changes made to any plant, animal or microorganism used in the product
how the GM food compares to an equivalent non-modified food, in terms of:
nutrition quality
what it is made of (for example, fats, proteins and carbohydrates)
The risks of GM techniques in the food supply are the same as for foods produced by conventional means. These include potential risks from:
toxic compounds
allergenic compounds
However, techniques used to produce GM foods may:
permit the transfer of genetic material from unrelated species
transfer a gene from an organism expressing a protein that has no history of use as a food
The safety assessment:
gives assurances that toxic or allergenic compounds are not transferred along with the desired characteristic when new DNA is introduced into an organism
assures that any genetic changes made to an organism do not increase the level of allergenic compounds or anti-nutrients which are naturally present in some organisms consumed as food

Identify: trait they want the corn to have (drought, herbicides, insect repellant). Find organism  (plant, animal, or microorganism) that has insect repellent. Gene in soil bacterium called bacillus thuringiensis, which produces a natural insecticide.
Copy: copy that gene in the Bt corn that would provide the insect-resistance trait.  
Insert: Insert DNA into the corn plant. Now, the corn has this new trait.

Grow: in tissue culture. Seeds produced inherit trait. 

Particle gun method
Coat the surface of small metal particles with the relevant DNA fragment and bombard the particles into the plant cells. 
Agrobacterium tumefaciens (most frequently used bacterium) method
Use bacterium or virus. Many of these that transfer DNA into a host cells as part of their normal life cycle. Gene of interest is transferred into bacterium which transfers the new DNA into the genome of a plant cell. 
Rare occasions this has happened naturally (sweet potato contains DNA sequences that were transferred thousands of years ago from Agrobacterium)

Lawsuits: Monsanto vs. Farmers
2013: The U.S. Supreme Court in Bowman vs. Monsanto unanimously ruled that farmers cannot replant patented genetically engineered (GE) seed as it violates licensing agreements. This means that farmers must pay industry giants like Monsanto for seed each growing season, sealing the agribusiness giant’s quest to fundamentally alter the nature of farming. This ruling is a blow to farmers who have been persecuted by Monsanto for ‘trespassing’ on patent rights due to saving seed or the contamination of fields by genetic drift of GE material. Read the story here.
March 2010: Monsanto Admits Bt Cotton has Failed in India For the first time anywhere in the world, biotech agriculture giant Monsanto has admitted that insects have developed resistance to its Bt (insect resistant) cotton crop. Evidence was observed by Monsanto from Gujarat province.

Monsanto owns patents on its genetic sequences and enforces its patent rights over these traits by suing farmers it believes have saved and used its seeds without authorization. When farmers buy Monsanto’s seeds they must sign a “Technology Use Agreement”, a contract with Monsanto whereby farmers agree not to save Monsanto’s seed for planting again. Monsanto now owns Terminator technology which would be the perfect tool for the corporation to protect its patents, without the bad public relations of suing farmers

The biotechnology industry promised that genetically modified (GM, also called genetically engineered) crops would reduce the use of pesticides in farming. Instead, herbicide use has increased with the use of GM crops. CBAN’s research found that herbicide sales in Canada have increased by 234% since GM crops have been introduced, between 1994 and 2020.



“What are called GMOs are done by changing the genes of the plant, and it’s done in a way where there’s a very thorough safety procedure, and it’s pretty incredible because it reduces the amount of pesticide you need, raises productivity (and) can help with malnutrition by getting vitamin fortification.And so I think, for Africa, this is going to make a huge difference, particularly as they face climate change 
The short film by the Center for Food Safety describes how the state of Hawaii, which hosts more open-air fields of experimental genetically engineered crops than any other state, has become contaminated with high volumes of toxic pesticides.
The film and report explain that five multinational agrichemical companies run 97% of GE field tests on Hawaii, and the large majority of the crops are engineered to survive herbicides. According to the video:
“With so many GE field tests in such a small state, many people in Hawaii live, work and go to school near intensively sprayed test sites. Pesticides often drift so it’s no wonder that children and school and entire communities are getting sick. To make matters even worse, in most cases, these companies are not even required to disclose what they’re spraying.”
