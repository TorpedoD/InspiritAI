Spoiled Fruit (Take Me on a Boat Ride)
Theodore Chiu

Take me on a boat ride,
Where the waves are still, there’s no tide,
Give me an easy life, I pray,
Let every danger wash away.

Once upon a time I wished to die,
But not because of a sorrow deep inside,
But a longing to be with the Lord,
Music of the spheres, the holy chord.

But the waves came crashing in,
Foundations began to cave in
Side my heart,
I sat,
Again,
In the ocean of my sin
I said I would never do 
Again –
Here I am,
Broken and I say,
“Take me away! Take me home!”
Have I drifted far?
My convictions ignored?
I keep praying.
He keeps calling.
I’m ignoring.
Stupid, foolish, silly games,
When will you learn,
To play,
For his heart.

Take me on a boat ride,
Where the waves are rough, where I may die,
All I ask is this, I pray,
Let me walk on water today.
