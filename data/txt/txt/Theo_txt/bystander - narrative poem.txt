some time ago
i watched winter become spring
and a little later
spring became winter

i began to realize it when i reached ten
that –
that there was something that needed fixing
like – 
i’m not sure what it was like

i became excited as i grew
as i saw A meet B
and the rest of the letters cheer
watching the beautiful conversations of the world

yet there was a moment in time
which made me think:
should i let the fox eat the rabbit?
or should i let nature run his business?
that had nothing to do with the real topic of course

silence became deadly
yet people love the deadly
why?
why are grief and sorrow and a sad film loved?
a sort of catharsis?
a sort of sparagmos?
but what can a goat really do?
bystanders try to be funny, too
again, there was something else that needed to be said
not this

i thought:
if the interstitial is so comfortable,
why is it so dangerous?
i watch only of course
the man in between heaven and hell
but white paint with a touch of darkness is soiled
i watched the darkness increase
i did not increase it
so i am of no blame, right?

it hit me –
like a train hits a pedestrian
and he flies in the air and crashes on the ground
that–
While I watched my parent’s pain,
While I watched creation cry,
While I watched gossip gain,
While I watched another alone,
While I watched thankfulness thieved,
While I watched the poor in need,
While I watched broken souls,
While I watched people talk about injustice,
While I watched mankind take His name,
it was like–
like– 
i was that kitsch decoration that stood on a bedside table with no purpose and no action but to remain there because it was a gift from someone that you loved

…

bystander, Bystander,
When will you do something?
