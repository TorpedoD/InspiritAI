News, APTN National. “Ontario Police to Reopen Thunder Bay Death Investigation.” APTN News, 27 June 2023, www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/ontario-police-open-new-investigations-into-historical-thunder-bay-deaths/. 

Summary: The Ontario Provincial Police will reopen investigations of the sudden deaths of 13 Indigenous people between 2006 and 2019. Robert Moskotaywenene was reported missing and found dead. The Thunder Bay Police said it was accidental drowning, something his family never believed. This is just like Jordan Wabasse and Jethro’s cases. Furthermore, the witness who found the body was never interviewed, physical evidence was not preserved with a covering, there was no canvas (interviewing residents), and there was no search for evidence. This was all in N. Ontario. Why and how did these deaths happen? No one knows for sure. The TBP said it was accidental; many do not agree.
