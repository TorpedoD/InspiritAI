INTRODUCTION:
What single displacements are.
History.
Activity series background. 
Why they are important or relevant.
Elements. 
Applications in daily life. 
At the end of intro, pivot towards your experiment (brief, to confirm what we have previously known on the activity series, we chose to investigate copper, magnesium, and zinc). Might be active voice, Predict results (hypothesis), 
How it will further science.  

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this experiments was to discover the order of reactivity of the metals copper, magnesium, and zinc in single displacement reactions. 

MATERIAL:
Refer to class handout.  

PROCEDURE: 
Refer to class handout. 
*Used 4 drops of each solution instead of 5. 

OBSERVATIONS and RESULTS:

Intro to observations. Refer to tables. 

Table 1: Qualitative Observations of Metals
Paragraph/Legend of for example + means malleable, ++ very malleable, - not malleable. 

Paragraph of Table.

Table 2: Qualitative Observations of Aqueous Solutions


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:

Error analysis:
Tweezers contamination. 
Not human mistakes. Human mistakes go in a separate footnote. 

Use analyze and interpret and conclude and communicate questions on pg. 189. 
Intro
1. For each single displacement. 
3. Rank the metals you tested. 
6. What evidence shows that hydrogen
2. Lithium metal reacts with water. Present as hypothetical or background knowledge. It is know that lithium reacts with water. 
Redo activity series and include lithium in your ranking. 
4. Explain how an activity series of metals can be used
5. GIven that lithium reacts with water
