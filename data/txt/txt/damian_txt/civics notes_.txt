Human rights vs legal rights
Human rights are universal 
All human beings are born free and equal
Basics civil rights

Universal Declaration of Human Rights
  1948 by the United Nations
  Outlines essential characteristics for peace, freedom, and justice in the world
  NOT legally binding (helps form various nations own policies)
  Rejects all forms of discrimination
All people have the right to: life, liberty, and security Freedom from discrimination Equality before the law Freedom of thought, conscience and religion Food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and social services Education

Positive rights: what everyone is entitled to have
Some things that your are given 
Access to health care 
Equal treatment under the law

Negative rights: what can not be taken away from everyone 
Somethings that you already have but can be taken away, so you have the negative right to protect yourself

Rights in canada
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
- Rights that all Canadians are entitled to have
Exceptions
Limitations Clause: Other laws may limit Charter Rights if the laws are reasonable and just in a democratic society
- Notwithstanding Clause: Provinces can temporarily override Charter Rights for up to 5 years
Refer to page 54

Non charter legal rights 
Rights that are not found in the charter but are in Federal and Provincial Legislation
Example:
Education is defined by laws in each individual province
-
Health Care is set by the Federal Government
Refer to page 55

Group rights 
Group Rights: Claimed by groups of individuals who share common features that are unchangeable (ex- gender)
Some of these groups would include: Indigenous peoples, Ethnic minority groups, Women, Children, People with disabilities
Each group holds specific rights separate from the rights of individuals
Pattern of discrimination against them as they are not always treated equally (ex- Children)

Important to protect rights
They are violated on a daily basis 
Having right means that there is a responsibility to protect them for the common good
Have rights=having responsibilities = protecting one’s own rights = protecting everyone’s rights = the common good 

Common good
Common = involving everyone
Good = something that is beneficial to everyone
The government is working towards the common good
Common good should benefit everyone equally 

The role of government 
Provide the parameters for everyday behavior for citizens 
Protect them from outside interference 
Provide for their well being and happiness 

Political spectrum
A political spectrum is an imaginary line that contains the range of opinions that exist on how to run a government and how to approach a political problem 
How does the it work
People use political spectrums to help them keep track of where a party “sits”, ideologically, on certain issues. 
This means that the spectrum helps organize the political platforms of the major political parties. 

Government structure in canada
Canaday operates in a multi level system of government federalism 
Purpose: to meet the needs of citizens who live in vastly different regions and have diverse needs

Yes we do need more levels 
There exists local issues and 'national issues which require different governing authorities to make informed and accurate decisions
There are many various issues that arise in each level of government
They may vary in urgency, and significance
All levels of government play a significant role in Canadian government

Why we need separate branches of government
All organizations have different structures, roles, and responsibilities
- School and family
Canada is structured into 3 branches
1. Legislative Branch: Power to make laws
2. Executive Branch: Power to administer laws
3. Judicial Branch: Power to apply laws
The three branches help to protect Canadians from concentrations of political power and privilege

Legislative Branch:
Monitor Government policies and actions
Represent citizens interests in government Debate and pass new laws
Executive Branch:
Set government policy
Initiate and draft new laws
Administer, implement, and enforce laws and policies
Judicial Branch:
Interpret and apply laws through court cases and decisions
Strike down laws that are unconstitutional

Power to choose government 
The electoral system 
The legal system where people vote, votes are counted and the people are elected or chosen to run the government 
There are different electoral systems and canada uses the first past the post system 
No limit of candidates who can run for election 
The candidate who gets the most votes wins 
You don’t need to get a majority just the most votes 
This system helps to ensure three is a winner in the election ever when vote turnout is low 
Voter turnout in canada has reached an all time low 

How does the system work?
Step 1: Electoral Districts
Provinces and Territories in Canada are divided into ridings (district or boundaries)
Voters choose their elected representative, who sits in the legislature on their behalf
Step 2: Candidates
- Candidates announce the will run in the election
- There is no limit to the number of candidates who can run in a district
- Political parties nominate their candidate representative
- Candidates can run without being linked to a party

Step 3: Election Campaign
Candidates and parties try to convince voters through advertising, media reports, phone calls, and social media campaigns
Step 4: Voting
Voters go to the polling station in their district on election day
Voters receive a paper ballot with all of the candidates' names, make a mark beside the person they choose, and place the ballot in the ballot box
Step 5: Counting Votes
- When polling stations are closed, ballots are counted
- The candidate with the most votes wins that election in that district
Step 6: Forming Government
- The political party with the most elected representatives is asked by the Crown to form a government
- The part with the second most votes forms the official opposition
Step 7: Government Leader
The party leader of the winning party becomes the leader of the government
- Government leader is responsible for managing all government services, departments, and employees
Step 8: Cabinet
-The prime minister chooses other elected representatives to form the cabinet
-Each cabinet member helps the prime minister manage a specific part of the government

Majority vs Minority
Example: If there are 308 members in a legislature
Majority Government:
-
First place party wins 158 seats/308 or 51%
-
Second play party becomes the official opposition Party A does not need the support of other parties
Minority Government:
  First place party wins the most seats, but less than 158 or lower than 51%
  Second place party becomes the official opposition
  Party A needs the support of other parties
Types of Voters
Responsible Voters:
Those that challenge their assumptions and think critically about what they see, hear, and read before voting
Dogmatic Voters:
Those that are absolutely certain that they are right regardless of what the evidence says
Popular Opinion Voters:
Those that vote one way because that is what everyone else is doing
