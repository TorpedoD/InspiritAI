The person I chose: My mom
Her Love language: physical touch, quality time, and acts of service
How I know: She is my mom and I literally knew her all my life, and she appreciates it the most when I spend quality time with her or hug her. When i show that i care about what she is doing and help, she would usually be very happy
Actions: 
In the morning I hugged my mom 
When she was tired I talked with her 
I helped her cook and clean up when she was tired 

Results: 
When I hugged my mom, she was in a good mood for the entire day, which made me happy too. She is very easy to please so I am very blessed. 
She usually likes to know about my life, so when I talk to her about my life she enjoys it alot because we talked for about an hour. 
She was very happy and relieved that I helped that day, I hope that was a good sign. But although it was very tiring, I still enjoyed helping my mom. 

Reflection: 
During this activity I became more aware of how to give and receive love. Sometimes people believe that sending money as a birthday or Christmas gift is very shroud and not very nice. But that is how my grandparents send their love, and by understanding their love language I can better understand them without misunderstanding them. This also helped me be more aware of how people receive love so I can better support my friends. Especially with people I am not familiar with I can get close to them by knowing their love language.
