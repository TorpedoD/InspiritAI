Brain rot subculture

Definition and Description

The concept of "Brain Rot‚Äù, within the Gen Z and Gen Alpha demographics refers to the perceived harm caused by consumption of low quality digital content, such as short videos and memes, on cognitive abilities and attention spans. Characterized by a turnover of content that often seems nonsensical or bizarre, the term "brain rot" captures its impact on focus and mental sharpness. According to Delgado (2023), it denotes a decline in faculties, intelligence, common sense or moral character commonly linked to social media and smartphone use. As mentioned in a SBS News article (2023), "brain rot" is used to describe content like memes and how they can negatively influence viewers, even becoming memes themselves through the intentional creation of "self aware brain rot content."

Slang and expressions, like "fanumtax," "Skibidi Toilet," "rizz," and "sigma male," play a role in the language of younger generations, providing insights into their online behaviours, values and cultural changes. For instance, "fanumtax" originated from streamer Fanum's habit of snagging snacks from friends during Twitch broadcasts. It has evolved to symbolize consuming content without much thought,  reflecting a critical view of endless scrolling on platforms such as TikTok and Reddit (Wired, 2023; Lima, 2024). Another example is "Skibidi Toilet," a web series by Alexey Gerasimov that became widely popular among youth for its humour, representing the kind of random, low quality content that fills the internet but also facing issues with copyrights due to its incorporation of popular music (Ingham, 2023; Reynolds, 2023). Then there's "rizz," a term introduced by streamer Kai Cenat to describe charm and the knack for capturing attention. It has now become a phrase in the vocabulary of Gen Z individuals within the realm of the "Brain Rot" subculture, which often criticizes content creators for relying on flashy yet shallow tactics (Mouriquand, 2023; The Color Explainer, 2024). The idea of the "sigma male" archetype, which stands in contrast to alpha male stereotypes, focuses on qualities like independence, self reliance and non conformity. This concept has struck a chord with generations who prioritize freedom and intellectual depth over social power. It gained traction after a blog post by Vox Day and a subsequent book by John T. Alexander brought it into the spotlight. Throughout 2021, the term gained immense popularity thanks to memes and discussions on social media. Notable figures associated with this concept include Andrew Tate and Steve Jobs, as mentioned in sources like Placido (2021) and Reix (2023). While some criticize the notion of isolation and anti social behaviour, the "sigma male" trend has significantly impacted internet culture. It frequently appears in hashtags, posts and memes that celebrate these characteristics. The widespread usage of "sigma" underscores its influence on platforms, reflecting a larger societal shift, towards valuing individuality and questioning traditional masculinity norms. This linguistic evolution demonstrates how internet slang can capture trends effectively; "sigma" serves as an example of how such terms can deeply resonate within online conversations.



History and Origins

The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the emergence of platforms, like TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels that have facilitated the dissemination of often mindless content. As these social media platforms became popular among the crowd, worries surfaced regarding the negative impacts of constant exposure to such content on their cognitive growth and ability to concentrate. Influential cultural shifts contributing to this trend include the rise of smartphones and widespread internet availability, granting individuals connectivity and exposure to global digital phenomena. Initially centered around sharing videos and memes that often seemed nonsensical out of context, this culture has evolved over time to encompass more intricate and occasionally surreal content showcasing the increasing creativity and technical prowess of its participants. The term "Brain Rot" itself emerged as a means to depict the perceived diminishing of thinking skills and attention spans due to the influx of fleeting low effort material. It gained popularity as a manner for Gen Z and Gen Alpha to acknowledge and scrutinize their consumption behaviors with a touch of self deprecation or irony. This self awareness and ironic detachment form integral components of the "Brain Rot" subculture. While the exact origins are ambiguous it likely surfaced in the early to mid 2010s amidst mounting concerns, about how internet culture might impact capacities. In 2007 people started using the term "brain rot" on media platforms, like Twitter to refer to content that seems numbing. Some content creators have humorously dubbed users of content as the "brain rot friend" (Lima, 2024; Gil, 2024).

However it has also seeped into real life discussions and connections among individuals, from Generation Z and Generation Alpha who are navigating the effects of their habits (Gil, 2024).

Geographical Spread

The "Brain Rot" subculture has spread worldwide crossing borders with the help of the internet and social media. Its impact is especially strong, in cities in countries where internet usage's high, like the US, UK, Canada and Australia. In these areas young people in both suburban settings are actively involved in the subculture due to their access, to digital devices and fast internet connections (Pew Research Center, 2024).

Nonmaterial Culture

The emergence of the "Brain Rot" subculture signifies a growing consciousness and criticism, among the generations Gen Z and Gen Alpha regarding the detrimental effects of excessive use of digital media and mindless online content on cognitive functions, concentration levels and overall well being (Hu, 2024). Despite its hearted or self critical nature this subculture serves as a platform for these age groups to connect over their shared encounters with digital behaviors and how they believe it impacts their mental capacities. This trend has attracted interest with researchers exploring its influence on youth culture, cognitive growth the evolution of internet subcultures and the psychological consequences of social media usage (Hu, 2024; Gil, 2024). Concerns raised by health experts revolve around the adverse effects of excessive consumption of low quality digital content on the well being and attention spans of young individuals. The essence of the "Brain Rot" phenomenon lies in elements like shared experiences, self aware humor mixed with irony related to consumption practices criticisms about the attention driven economy and commercialization of effortless content creation.

Bias and Ethics

As a member of Generation Z researching the "Brain Rot" subculture without involvement it was crucial for me to remain objective and reflective. Being part of this generation made me susceptible, to finding certain slang or behaviors irritating or silly which could introduce bias into my work. When documenting insights from interviews or online communities I made an effort to avoid injecting my opinions. Ensuring accuracy and combatting misinformation in spaces was vital. I checked and cross referenced various credible sources, such as academic studies, media articles and firsthand observations to develop a thorough understanding of the subculture. Regular peer reviews and discussions with experts in culture and ethics helped validate the integrity and precision of my research. As an observer who did not participate directly I consistently reflected on biases and preconceptions about the subculture. Continuously examining how personal biases or assumptions could impact data interpretation was a practice. I maintained an open minded approach ready to adapt my methods or viewpoints based on insights or feedback from subculture members and experts. Adhering to standards conducting fact checks and engaging in introspection were key elements, in upholding objectivity and reflection throughout my research journey.

Research Assessment

The study, on the "Brain Rot" subculture within the Gen Z and Gen Alpha generations used a combination of methods, including research and interviews with younger individuals. The online research involved examining media trends, articles, academic papers and reliable sources discussing the phenomena and related slang terms like "Fanumtax," "Skibidy Toilet ". Rizz." This approach helped in grasping the evolution, widespread usage and overall context of these phrases. However delving into communities was challenging many users employed these terms without fully comprehending their background. On the hand interviews with participants offered qualitative perspectives on how these slang terms are used in everyday life enriching the statistical and theoretical insights gathered online. Despite their effectiveness both methods faced obstacles and constraints. Notably misinformation prevalent on platforms often prioritized engagement over accuracy making it difficult to validate information. This issue was especially pronounced when trying to trace the origins of slang terms since many interviewees confessed to using phrases without knowing their source due to peer influence, than credible references.
Moreover the interviewees faced a challenge due, to their knowledge about the origins of these terms mostly picking them up from friends without delving. To tackle this issue information from sources was cross checked for accuracy and fact checking against sources like academic articles and credible media reports was done to sift out any misinformation. Asking probing questions during interviews prompted participants to assess their sources of information and how they use slang terms. For studies an organized interview approach could involve participants with deeper insights or those who have conducted their own research within the subculture. Employing ethnography could also offer an immersive understanding of the online communities where these slang terms and cultural practices stem from and develop further. Enlarging the sample size and including groups, from Gen Z and Gen Alpha would provide a more comprehensive insight into the subculture.
