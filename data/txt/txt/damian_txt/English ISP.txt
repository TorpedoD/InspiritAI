“No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin, his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.” This quote from Nelson Mandela shows that just as hate can be learned, so too can love be taught, for it is a natural characteristic of the human heart. Within Markus Zusak's "The Book Thief" and Nic Stone's "Dear Martin," we embark on an immersive journey, peeling back the layers of deep-rooted complexities surrounding racism and injustice in our society. These powerful narratives unravel the intricacies of discrimination, reinforce Mandela's belief that hatred is learned, and highlight the transformative power of storytelling in shaping our perceptions and fostering empathy. Through the characters' arduous struggles against prejudice, their unwavering resilience, and their unyielding quest for justice, they shine light through another lens of perspective. The books Dear Martin and The Book Thief both address the problems of racism, psychological trauma, and marginalizing minority groups through acts of injustice within society. 
Rooted deeply within society, racism perpetuates a web of systemic injustice and creates devastating divisions among communities. The Book Thief unflinchingly unveils the profound impact of racial prejudice, taking us on a poignant journey through the darkest chapters of Nazi Germany. Systemic racism emerges more clearly and displays itself more explicitly in this historical setting, permeating every sphere of life and dehumanizing people. “You could argue that Liesel Meminger had it easy. She did have it easy compared to Max Vandenburg. Certainly, her brother had practically died in her arms. Her mother abandoned her. But anything was better than being a Jew.” (Zusak, 161) Through such passages, the book draws attention to the harrowing plight of Jewish people, highlighting the depth of discrimination they faced from Nazis and Germans alike. Max Vandenburg, a Jewish man, serves as a representative figure among the countless Jews who suffered persecution, and his experiences showcase the extremity of their mistreatment. 
In a different sense, Dear Martin' sheds light on its ongoing fight against racial bias. It explores the issues of racial profiling, the discriminatory treatment of Justyce, and the pressure of cultural expectations on young black men. By following Justyce's journey, the novel reveals how prejudice has a poisonous effect on the basic foundation of our society.  A key moment is when we see how a police officer treats Justyce. "I know your kind: punks like you wander the streets of nice neighbourhoods searching for prey. Just couldn't resist the pretty white girl who'd locked her keys in her car, could ya?" (Stone, 8) This occurrence brings to light the systemic racism embedded within the criminal justice system and the unjust targeting of people based purely on their skin tone. Justyce constantly feels the pressure to prove himself, slowly learning throughout the book that the problems he faces are solely attributed to the stereotypes and racial bias associated with being an African American. 
Both The Book Thief and Dear Martin share a common focus on the profound impact of racial prejudice on individuals and communities. The systematic prejudice against Jews during the Nazi era is eloquently illustrated in The Book Thief, highlighting the dehumanization, persecution, and suffering this community endured. The risks of uncontrolled intolerance are illustrated by the Nazi regime's persistent anti-Semitism. Similarly, "Dear Martin" addresses the issues of racial bias in modern-day America, particularly as it relates to the criminal justice system. The book explores the facts of racial profiling and the unfair treatment that black people experience, highlighting how entrenched prejudice is in modern society. While the effects of racial prejudice are discussed in both novels, The Book Thief gives a horrifying account of those effects in a particular historical era, emphasizing the perils of unrestrained hate. Dear Martin, in contrast, explores the realities of racial profiling and unfair treatment inside the criminal justice system. Set in the present environment of the United States, the novel sheds emphasis on the persistent problems that black people experience by exposing the continual struggles they endure.
While racism is a pernicious and ingrained social problem, it has also long been known to be a catalyst for violence and to foster a toxic environment that shatters communities and individuals, causing conflict. In The Book Thief, it focuses on the psychological trauma that individuals bear by portraying the horrifying violence inflicted upon Jews during the infamous Night of Broken Glass, also known as Kristallnacht. Max is emotionally torn in his struggle between a sense of duty to his family and the overwhelming relief he experiences when he is separated from them. “He clung to his mother’s hand and that of Sarah, the nearest of his cousins. “I won’t leave. If we can’t all go, I don’t go, either.” He was lying. When he was pushed out by the rest of his family, the relief struggled inside him like an obscenity. It was something he didn’t want to feel, but nonetheless, he felt it with such gusto it made him want to throw up. How could he? How could he? But he did.” (Zusak, 193) The emotional turmoil Max undergoes serves as a powerful illustration of the psychological impact of racism-driven violence. It sheds light on the complex emotions experienced by individuals torn between their allegiance to their loved ones and the relief that accompanies their separation.
The psychological wounds inflicted by racism-driven violence cut deep, leaving lasting scars on the individuals who bear witness to its horrors. Dear Martin similarly captures the impact of such violence through the hardship of Justyce. The constant fear, anxiety, and internal conflict he experiences vividly depict the insidious ways in which racism infiltrates one's psyche, leaving lasting scars that are not easily healed. As Justyce navigates the aftermath of police brutality, he is forced to question the very foundations of his beliefs. "In a way, I guess I thought I didn't really need to concern myself with this type of thing because compared to him, I don't come across as 'threatening,' you know? I don't sag my pants or wear my clothes super big. I go to a good school, and have goals and vision and 'a great head on my shoulders,' as Mama likes to say." (Stone, 12) The weight of this trauma shapes his journey, propelling him to seek understanding, challenge societal norms, and fight for justice in a world that repeatedly threatens to undermine his humanity.
In both stories, the character grapples with the internal turmoil and emotional trauma caused by witnessing violence rooted in discrimination. Exploring the psychological wounds inflicted by racism-driven violence, we see that Dear Martin uses Justyce's constant fear, anxiety, and internal conflict to illustrate the insidious infiltration of racism into one’s mind. Similarly, The Book Thief uses Max to portray the emotional trauma faced by those targeted by the Nazis. Both books use the disillusionment and trauma faced by marginalized individuals to demonstrate injustice. Throughout the novels, we witness how discriminatory beliefs and systemic oppression fuel the flames of hatred, pushing individuals to commit acts of aggression and brutality. An example of this is how some marginalized black communities resort to gang violence to protect themselves from systematic injustice. While both books share the same idea of exploring the internal conflicts faced by the characters, The Book Thief focuses on the resilience of the human spirit. Dear Martin delves into Justyce's personal journey and how one confronts the psychological and societal impacts of racism in a contemporary setting. 
In the face of violence and injustice, there are often bystanders who choose to remain silent or turn a blind eye. However, there are also those brave enough to stand up for what is right, even at great personal risk. Whether it is a small act of kindness or a brave stance against discrimination, “The Book Thief” demonstrates this idea through the character and actions of Hans Hubermann. Despite the prevailing Nazi ideology and the punishment that he would receive, Hans's opposition to the Nazi ideals is shown through his caring actions. "The Jew stood before him, expecting another handful of derision, but he watched with everyone else as Hans Hubermann held his hand out and presented him with a piece of bread, like magic." (Zusak, 394). He shows his compassion and care for others, regardless of their racial or religious origin, by giving one of the Jews a slice of bread. He was endangering his family's safety in addition to his own. Injustice was sustained by the Nazi system's power dynamics, which were reinforced when anyone tried to criticize it.
The difficult choice that spectators must make and the terrible results of their silence are explored in Dear Martin through the actions of Justyce McAllister and his friend Manny Rivers. “Truth is, four hours ago, Jus was ready to back out because the idea of going anywhere with Jared and crew just felt wrong, knowing what he knows about how they think. But then he stumbled upon Martin's definition of integration- ‘intergroup and interpersonal living’ -and decided to just go with it. He's not sure this is exactly what Martin meant, but what is he supposed to say?” (Stone, 41 - 42) This section encapsulates the difficult predicament faced by bystanders, and Justyce later faces the consequences of his inaction. Justyce's decision to remain silent and passively participate in the Halloween party perpetuates the cycle of discrimination, allowing it to thrive. This portrayal of bystander inaction emphasizes the consequences of not taking a stand against social injustice illustrating the potential harm caused by bystanders who fail to challenge the prevailing systems of oppression.
These works demonstrate how bystanders who strive to assist minority groups frequently face harsh punishments. They emphasize the social constraints and outcomes of standing up against injustice and examine how spectators' behaviour or inactivity affects maintaining or addressing social injustice. Even though they share a common thread in illustrating the significance of individual choices in shaping the course of social justice. Dear Martin focuses mainly on the consequences of bystanders who choose to remain passive observers in the face of injustice. It highlights the struggles that the spectators have during the decision making process. As the consequences of inaction are minute compared to The Book Thief, it allows the characters to doubt what they believe in and fall into a state of indecisiveness. On the other hand, "The Book Thief" delves into the bravery of those who choose to act in the face of violence and injustice. Since the decisions in this book determine life or death, there is no room for thought or a debate between choices. This forces characters to act according to what they believe in, despite the personal risks involved. 
In the face of deep-rooted racism and injustice, the narratives of Markus Zusak's The Book Thief and Nic Stone's Dear Martin weave together a tapestry of powerful stories. Both offer powerful narratives that delve into the deep-rooted complexities surrounding racism and injustice in our society. They emphasize the need for empathy, understanding, and a will to resist injustice. With The Book Thief, referencing how people are punished for assisting and supporting minority groups, and Dear Martin, using Justice's terrible experiences to highlight how disadvantaged certain individuals may feel. These works allow us to address the systemic injustices that divide our communities and cultivate empathy, understanding, and love. As Nelson Mandela once said, "No one is born hating another person," and these books remind us that love and compassion can be nurtured and taught, ultimately leading to a more just and inclusive society.
