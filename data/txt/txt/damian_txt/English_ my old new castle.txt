a. Author's Purpose and Feelings About Home
David Adams Richards fondly looks back on his youth, in Newcastle as he shares feelings of longing for the transformations that have taken place in his hometown over the years. He vividly contrasts his memories with the day's commercial setting by remarking; "The town has tripled in size now; instead of fields and lumber yards along the roadways, like before there are fast food chains and shopping centers." His words convey a sense of sorrow for the fading essence of the town. 

b. Sensory Imagery
Throughout the short story, by Richards there are a few descriptions that bring the scenes to life for readers â€“ mentioning "the elongated spires of our churches", and "the crimson leaves". It also captures the scents such as "the aroma of burning mud and grass." These detailed descriptions vividly recreate his memories. 

c. Function of the Short Sentence
The concise statement "The Miramichi functions as a working river " stands out in the short story a lot. It highlights the river's importance in the author's reminiscences and local identity. Its straightforwardness contrasts with the portrayals in the short story, and it emphasizes the river's role as an unwavering presence, amidst evolving surroundings. 

d. Title and Structure Reflection
The title implies a sense of nostalgia by focusing on memories and transitions over time. The essay follows a timeline from childhood recollections to a look at the present moments, successfully capturing the contrast between the past and present. This emphasizes the progression of time and the writer's conflicting emotions, toward their hometown. 

2. Literature Studies Essay Structure
Richards organizes his short story in a timeline format as he recounts the seasons of his childhood in Newcastle; beginning with winter pastimes and progressing through the arrival of spring, to the warmth of summer and the colors of autumn while portraying the characteristics of each season vividly before concluding with reflections on present day changes in the towns surroundings. This sequential arrangement helps the author's content by enabling readers to observe both the transformations in nature and society as well as Richardss own development and evolving perspectives over time. 

3. Film Study
In his short story Richards talks about how the movies he and his friends watched as kids didn't really mirror their lives or experiences in Canada at that time. He mentions a film that does a job of showing what life is. The movie goes into the challenges of being a teenager, the ups and downs of friendships and the dynamics within families. It shows a view of what it's like to come of age. Many movies, comics, and social media nowadays tend to idealize high school life and relationships in a way that's not all that realistic. Though these movies satisfy our imagination of a perfect person. It just becomes a depiction of life that just feels too perfect to be true and doesn't capture the ups and downs that teens go through every day. Although I do like to watch these films I sometimes will enjoy films that show real life experiences to keep me grounded in reality, and to also see that others also have difficult problems. 

4. Connection to Fahrenheit 451
The ideas discussed in David Adams Richardss essay reflect those found in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 when it comes to how societal shifts affect identity and the sense of community. These writers both criticize the thoughtlessness of modern life. In Fahrenheit 451, individuals lack genuine connections, opting for entertainment over relationships, leading to a fragmented society. Similarly Richards notes how commercialism has taken over areas in Newcastle prompting a decline in connections. The two stories show that when there are no relationships, within a community it can break down like our solar system would fall apart without the pull of the sun's gravity holding it together. In the end they emphasize how important it is to build social connections and maintain the core of our communities to prevent losing ourselves to a purposeless life.
