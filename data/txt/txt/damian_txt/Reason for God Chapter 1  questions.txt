Reason for God Chapter 1

Chapter 1: There Can’t Be Just One True Religion
1. Keller says he has often asked non-Christians, “What is your biggest problem with Christianity? What troubles you most about its beliefs or how it is practiced?” [p. 3]  
Yes he does say that. 
2. Keller agrees with the notion that religions claiming exclusivity of their beliefs are a barrier to world peace [p. 4] Do you agree with Keller? Do you find his agreement surprising? Can you understand why exclusivity can be a concern of many in our culture?
I do agree with Keller, and I don’t find his view surprising. Exclusivity, or the idea that only one belief system holds absolute truth, can make it hard for people from different backgrounds to connect and understand each other. In a diverse world, exclusivity can breed division, often because it implies that those with different beliefs are somehow "wrong" or less enlightened. Our culture values inclusivity and respect for all perspectives, so it’s easy to see why exclusivity is seen as a stumbling block to peace. However, I also see that exclusivity can come from a place of conviction, so it’s not always malicious or divisive by intent.
3. Define, as objectively and carefully as possible, the three approaches to try to deal with the divisiveness of religion: to outlaw it [p. 5-6], to condemn it [p. 7-13], and to restrict it the private sphere of life [p. 13-18]. Where have you noticed or encountered such approaches? What does Keller identify as the flaw in each approach? Do you agree they are flaws? 

The three approaches to addressing religious divisiveness are: outlawing religion, condemning it, and restricting it to the private sphere. Outlawing religion aims to eliminate it entirely, as seen in authoritarian regimes, but often leads to resistance and resentment. Condemning religion by labeling it as irrational or outdated attempts to discredit faith, though it usually strengthens believers’ resolve rather than weakening it. Restricting religion to the private sphere suggests people keep their faith separate from public life, but this ignores how deeply beliefs influence individuals’ actions and values. Keller critiques each approach for failing to foster true understanding and respect, and I agree with his view that these solutions are ultimately ineffective.
4. “Ironically, the insistence that doctrines do not matter is really a doctrine itself” [p. 8]. What is a good, winsome way to present this truth to a skeptic without seeming arrogant or insensitive or offensive?

A good way to present this might be to gently point out that everyone has beliefs or values they consider important, whether they’re religious or not. I might say, “Isn’t it interesting that even the idea that ‘doctrines don’t matter’ can be a doctrine of its own?” By framing it as an observation rather than a criticism, it keeps the conversation open and respectful.
5. Given the refutation of the “story of the blind men and the elephant” [p. 8-9], how do we make this argument while maintaining the humility appropriate to knowing we see only in part, through a glass darkly (see 1 Corinthians 13)?

Instead of rejecting the story outright, I’d acknowledge that the story has value in showing how partial perspectives can exist. But I might add, “The story assumes that someone does have the full perspective—the person who sees the whole elephant.” It’s a gentle way of showing that we can’t dismiss all perspectives as partial if there’s even the possibility of someone seeing more of the truth.
6. Keller says, “The reality is that we all make truth-claims of some sort and it is very hard to weigh them responsibly, but we have no alternative but to try to do so” [p. 11]; “We are all exclusive in our beliefs about religion, but in different ways” [p. 13]. How do you weigh your truth-claims? 

Personally, I weigh my truth-claims by examining where they come from and whether they align with values I hold, like empathy, fairness, and consistency. I also look for evidence or experiences that support them. I believe it’s essential to hold these claims with an open hand—willing to adjust or even let go of them as I encounter new ideas or insights.
7. Because “all of us have fundamental, unprovable faith-commitments that we think are superior to those of others,” Keller argues that we must ask, “which fundamentals will lead their believers to be the most loving and receptive to those with whom they differ?” [p. 19-20]. What “fundamentals” would apply to Christians? Why do so many Christians tend to act as if such fundamentals do not apply to them, since they are neither loving nor receptive?

For Christians, some key fundamentals include love, grace, humility, and compassion—qualities that Jesus emphasized. However, Christians sometimes lose sight of these when they feel threatened or defensive about their beliefs. It’s easy for any group to focus more on defending their position than on loving others, and I think that’s what sometimes leads Christians to act in ways that seem at odds with their core beliefs.
8. Does it shock you when Keller says that Christians should expect to find nonbelievers who are “much nicer, kinder, wiser, and better than they are”? [p. 19].
It doesn’t shock me, but it’s refreshing to hear. It’s a reminder that goodness isn’t exclusive to any one belief system. In my experience, kindness, wisdom, and compassion can be found in people of all beliefs, and acknowledging this shouldn’t threaten anyone’s faith. Rather, it’s a chance to learn from others.
9. Review the title of this chapter—does Keller fully answer this question, or does he primarily level the playing field for conversations with skeptics?
I think Keller’s main goal here is to level the playing field. Instead of providing a definitive answer, he challenges the notion that only one view can hold truth. By doing this, he opens the door for a conversation about exclusivity in a way that feels fair to skeptics, encouraging them to see that while Christianity may make exclusive claims, it’s not necessarily the only group to do so.
