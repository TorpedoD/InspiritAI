5.1 
Terms 
Variable (quantity with set value, ie. height of a person)
One variable statistic (one quantity or attribute)
Numerical 
Discrete (gap, #siblings)
Continuous (no gap, race finish time)
Categorical 
Nominal (not ranked, music type)
Ordinal (ranked, top 10 movies)
Data set (collection of data)
Raw 
Summarized

Misleading statistics
Graphs must start at 0 otherwise the growth can be misleading. 

Reasons to study data
Being and informed “information consumer”
Understanding and making decisions 
Evaluate decision that affect you  

Different graphs
Histograms / Frequency polygons (no gaps)
Note: select middle value before drawing (ie. midpoint of interval 2-13 = 7.5)

Cumulative frequency graph


Dot plot + Scatter plot + Line graph 


Bar graph + pictograph + pie charts/circle graph

Stem and leaf plot 



5.2 Principles of Data Collection
Terms 
Population - all individuals who belong to the group being studied 
Sample - the group that is studied/ surveyed within the population
(chosen by sampling techniques, carefully selected samples can give accurate information)
Sampling frame - people that can be selected to be part of a sample
changes depending on the sampling technique used 
all of population is selected if the total people in a group is 100 or less
for other group sizes, 20% of people are selected
access and availability of the individuals in the representative group
availability of resource to use in the selection process 
technical expertise of people involved in the data collection

Sampling Techniques 
Systematic Sampling 
A list of the members of the target population is compiled
A name on the list is chosen as a starting point
Every kth name is selected (k is randomly selected)
Simple Random Sampling
Involves using a random number table
A list is compiled of the eligible participants in each group
Each name is assigned a sequential number, beginning with 0
Beginning with that chosen number, include the participant’s whose number matches the number generated next on the random number table
Stratified Random Sampling (Used when representation within a particular sample is necessary)
Proportional random sampling - done by using simple random sampling for each of the each of the subgroups according to their representation proportionately to the entire group (subgroups are a certain scaled down proportion of the main group)
Equal allocation stratified sampling is used when the same number of group members is selected from each group, using simple random sampling, regardless of the total size of the group.
Cluster Random Sampling
Entire groups, not individuals, are selected to participate in the data collection
Simple random sampling is applied to the representative “clusters” to select the clusters in which all members will participate
Voluntary-Response Sample
researcher simply invites any member of the population to participate in the survey
Results from the responses of such surveys can be skewed (prone to response or non-response bias)
Convenience sampling 
Sample selected based on its ease of accessibility
Multi-Stage Random Sample 
uses several levels of random sampling 
uses division within subdivisions  

5.3
2 types of experiments
Treatment group
All participants who receive the specific treatment being measured
Control group
Do not receive treatment
Test placebo effect (person receives treatment with no effect but thinks it has effect)
assess the effectiveness of treatment 

Good experimental studies 
Control (variables need to be controlled)
randomization (minimize bias)
replication (experiment must be repeatable)

Good survey questions 
Anonymous, validity, no leading questions, keep it simple

5.4
Types of sources of data
Primary source (collected by researcher)
Secondary source (data taken from researchers)
Microdata (individual set of data about a single respondent)
Aggregate data (data that is combined or summarized in a way that the individual microdata can no longer be determined)

5.5 Bias
Response Bias 
when participants change their answers to avoid embarrassment, influence the results, or to give the answer they think the questioner wants
Sampling Bias 
when the sample does not closely represent the population
Measurement Bias 
when the collection method is such that the characteristics are consistently overrepresented or underrepresented
Non-response bias
when opinions of respondents differ in meaningful ways from those of non-respondents
 
For questions that ask whether something is a lot:
Divide numbers to usually find the number of something / person to determine whether it is a lot or just deception 

Evaluating secondary sources
Credibility (trustworthy source, author’s credentials, evidence of quality control, known or respected authority, organizational supported 
Accuracy (up to date and detailed, comprehensive, exact)  
Reasonableness (fair, balanced, objective, reasoned, no conflict of interest, absence of fallacies or slanted tone
Support (listed sources, contact information, available corroboration, claims supported, documentation supplied)`
