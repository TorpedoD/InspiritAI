What are your proudest accomplishments? 







Please neatly write a brief summary of some highlights that may give your referee  more insight into how you are qualified for this award/scholarship and/or about  your post-secondary goals. 

My goals for post secondary education is to either enter cyber security or AI development. My goal in the future by taking post secondary education is to Design a personal AI assistant like Jarvis from Iron Man, discover how to make AI models more efficient by learning more about CPU design, or design an AI model to improve network security and help detect vulnerabilities in systems. I will be studying computer engineering to gain a better understanding on these topics in both the hardware and software. 
What else would you like your referee to know/include about you? *If relevant, please consider attaching a resume for your referee as well.
