In monocots, vascular bundles are typically scattered throughout the stem, often arranged in a complex pattern. The root cross-section in monocots displays vascular tissue forming a scattered ring. Monocot leaves exhibit parallel venation, where the veins run parallel to each other. Additionally, monocots have one cotyledon, the seed leaf, in their embryo.
Dicots exhibit distinct microscopic characteristics. Dicot stems often have vascular bundles arranged in a ring or a more organized manner. Dicot roots display vascular tissue forming a central cylinder in a more organized pattern. The leaves of dicots usually have reticulate venation, forming a branching network of veins

Monocots are characterized by their long and narrow leaves, often with parallel-sided blades. Their root systems are typically fibrous, lacking a prominent taproot. In terms of floral characteristics, monocots usually have their floral parts in multiples of three, such as petals in groups of three. Dicot leaves come in various shapes, including oval, heart-shaped, or lobed. They usually have a taproot system with a well-defined central root. Dicot flowers exhibit floral parts in multiples of four or five, with petals typically found in groups of four or five. 

It promotes hygiene by removing potential contaminants, including microorganisms and chemicals that could be harmful if ingested or come into contact with the face, eyes, or mouth. It helps prevent the transfer of contaminants from the investigation materials to other surfaces, equipment, or individuals, thereby reducing the risk of cross-contamination. Proper hand hygiene is essential for safety, especially when investigations involve handling hazardous materials, as it minimizes the risk of accidental exposure.
