Introduction: Lead/Thesis  Statement  

The books “Dear martin” and “The Book thief” both address the problems of racism, acts of violence, and marginalizing minority groups. 

Body  
Main Idea #1 racism 

Detail #1: Systemic Racism
Racism against Jews is pervasive in "The Book Thief," is especially underlined by the persecution and dehumanization of the Jewish characters, they are discriminated against by the law and unfairly. Due to his African American background, Justyce, experiences racial profiling and harsh treatment by the police in "Dear Martin," illustrating the systematic racism still present in modern society.



Detail #2: Racial Stereotypes
 In "The Book Thief," characters like Rudy, face discrimination and ridicule due to his physical features, which align with the Nazi ideal of Aryan superiority. Additionally, Jewish characters are often stigmatized and portrayed as villains solely based on their ethnicity. Similarly, in "Dear Martin," racial stereotypes are addressed through the experiences of Justyce, who is stereotyped as dangerous or criminal due to his race, despite his achievements and character.

Detail #3:  Interpersonal Racism
The books discuss racism on a human level, showing how people support discriminatory actions. Frau Diller, Liesel's next-door neighbour in "The Book Thief," is a representation of the anti-Semitism and racism that characterized Nazi Germany. Her hostility against Liesel's foster family and her disparaging remarks about Jews are reflections of the pervasive interpersonal racism in society. In "Dear Martin," Justyce's classmates act prejudiced against him because of his colour and make racial jokes. These incidents show how racism can have an effect on relationships and cause division on a personal level.





Main Idea #2 violence 



Detail #1: Physical Violence
The physical violence in "The Book Thief" and "Dear Martin" highlights the terrible circumstances the protagonists must deal with. As the main character, Liesel Meminger, watches the devastation and deaths brought on by the bombing attacks during World War Two, violence is powerfully shown during this time in "The Book Thief." Similar to this, the main character in "Dear Martin," Justyce McAllister, suffers physical harm when he is attacked by a police officer, highlighting the racial tensions and police brutality that are pervasive in society.


Detail #2: Structural Violence
The structural violence that exists when social, political, and economic systems support human injustice and misery is also discussed in both works. As Liesel experiences the persecution of Jews, the censoring of books, and the dissolution of communities, "The Book Thief" examines the systemic cruelty of the Nazi government. This demonstrates the terrible effects that a tyrannical government has on the lives of regular people. The book "Dear Martin" discusses systematic racism and the injustices that underprivileged populations experience. The protagonists run across prejudice in the criminal court system, school system, and society at large, illuminating the structural violence ingrained in the system.


Detail #3: Verbal and Emotional Violence 
Violence can take the form of verbal and emotional abuse in addition to physical assaults. In "The Book Thief," Liesel is subjected to verbal abuse by Rosa Hubermann, her foster mother, who constantly yells and belittles her. This emotional abuse makes Liesel's already challenging situation—coping with the death of her family and the harsh environment of Nazi Germany—even more challenging. In "Dear Martin," the main character Justyce experiences racist epithets and disparaging remarks from his classmates and even certain authority people, underscoring the pervasive racism and prejudice in his neighborhood.



Main Idea #3  bystanders not being able or penalized for helping 



Detail #1: Social Isolation and Ostracism
Bystanders who choose to help minority groups often face social isolation and ostracism from their peers and the larger community. In "The Book Thief," Hans and Rosa Hubermann, risk their safety by hiding a Jewish man, Max Vandenburg, in their basement during World War II. Their acts of compassion and defiance against the Nazi regime led to their neighbours and acquaintances viewing them with suspicion and hostility. Similarly, in "Dear Martin," Justyce McAllister is shunned and ridiculed by his classmates and some members of the community when he speaks out against racial injustice.


Detail #2: Legal Consequences and Threats
Bystanders who assist minority groups may face legal consequences or threats from those in power. In "The Book Thief," Hans Hubermann's act of sheltering Max Vandenburg puts him at risk of being discovered by the Nazis, which could lead to severe punishment, including imprisonment or death. Similarly, in "Dear Martin," when Justyce attempts to intervene in an incident of racial profiling, he becomes a target of unjust accusations and threats from both the police and influential individuals who try to silence his activism.


Detail #3: Professional or Academic Consequences
Bystanders who help minority groups may experience negative repercussions in their professional or academic lives. In "The Book Thief," Hans, is a painter who becomes blacklisted by the Nazi party due to his refusal to join them. This exclusion prevents him from finding work and hinders his ability to provide for his family. In "Dear Martin," Justyce's activism and outspokenness against racial injustice bring him into conflict with school administrators and some of his teachers, who question his character and abilities, ultimately affecting his academic standing and future prospects.


Conclusion
