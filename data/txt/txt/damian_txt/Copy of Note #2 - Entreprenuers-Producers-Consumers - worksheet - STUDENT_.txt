UNDERSTANDING BUSINESS
GROUP 1:  ENTREPRENEURS, PRODUCERS, AND CONSUMERS
Entrepreneurs: (Def’n with examples)
 people who take a risk and start a business to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.
they often go into business to satisfy a need that is not being met in the marketplace
 businesses cannot exist without the people who start them, manage them, and work in them.

As a group come up with 3 entrepreneurs of companies whose products or services you use (clue:  think McDonald’s, Amazon.com, Facebook, etc.):
 
 
 

Producers
 an individual or business that makes a product (good  or service) 

Consumer
 a person who buys goods and services, also known as a customer.
 a person can be both a producer and a consumer of a product.
 think of a computer repair shop that could build a computer and then use it to do their accounting on making them a consumer.



GROUP 2:  GOODS AND SERVICES

Goods
 selling items, or something 
 

Services
 something you do for someone
 
 




As a group, list 3 services that companies offer that you as a teenager would use:
 freedom (provides phone)
 



GROUP 3:  ESSENTIAL AND LUXURY GOODS AND SERVICES

Essential goods and services
 things we need for survival 
 essential goods include: food, clothing, shelter
 essential services include: heating, hydro and water

Luxury goods and services
 things that are enjoyable but not necessary for survival 
 goods something you want to need
 services want it 

As a group come up with 1 good and 1 service that would be considered a luxury for teenagers and justify why they should be essential goods:


	Good #1:
	Justification: Laptop - schools say you need one




	Service #1
	Justification: Phone Plan - so you can communicate with other people at any time, and have access to emergency services. 










GROUP 4:  ECONOMIC RESOURCES

 Economic resources or factors of production are means through which goods and services are made available  to consumers
There are three kinds of economic resources: 



Natural Resources 
 the raw materials that are used in production and that are often limited in quantity 
 soil, iron ore, gold, treesm animals water

  

Human Resources
 the people who works to creat the goods and services, known as labour
 farmers, factory workers, teachers, nerses, designers



Capital Resources
 are the third factor of production and usually last for a long period of time and require substantial investment.
 buildings, equipment, tools, trucks, factories, and money


Entrepreneurship
 Good ideas





Do you think 1 resource is more important than another?  Explain.

“You can’t have one without the other”
