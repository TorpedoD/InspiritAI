SNC2D Date: ____________________  Mutations: Causes, Consequences and Safeguards  
A mutation is an alteration, or change, in the gene'c code of an organism. A muta'on  can be either at the DNA level or at the Chromosomal level. A DNA muta'on occurs  when one or more set of bases do not match up. Examples include cancers, cys'c  fibrosis, albinism and progeria (a disease where people grow old very quickly, and typically die  in their early teens). A chromosome muta'on occurs when the Number of  chromosomes is different than the number that there should be. Humans should have 46  chromosomes (23 different pairs), but some'mes they have an extra chromosome or they are  missing one. Examples include Down’s syndrome (an extra copy of C21) and Crie du Chat  (missing part of C5).  
Muta'ons can occur naturally, but they can also be caused by mutagens. Mutagens can  be chemical or physical. Many of the chemicals that humans emit that are  responsible for GCC and environmental damage are also mutagens. Examples include  Smog (low level ozone), smoke and dioxins. Physical mutagens include radia'on from X rays and the sun. As the ozone layer is depleted, more solar radia'on reaches the  earth’s surface. This has been correlated to increased levels of skin cancers.  
Muta'ons can be of three types: Neutrol, beneficial or  harmful. Neutral muta'ons may have no outward effect on the organism or  their effects neither help nor harm the organism. An example would include a new hair colour. Beneficial muta'ons are muta'ons that would Help the organism. An  example would be a more efficient oxygen carrier molecule or a bacterium that develops  an'bio'c resistance. Harmful muta'ons are muta'ons that Hurt  the organism,  such as cancers and cys'c fibrosis.

The muta'on type can also vary based on the Environment in which an organism lives.  A neutral muta'on may become harmful or beneficial in a different  environment or vice versa. An example of this is sickle cell anaemia. It can prevent malaria, a  dangerous parasite, but it can also result in a decreased ability to carry oxygen in the blood.  
The cell has safeguards to prevent most muta'ons from geXng out of control. As  cells move between the different stages of interphase, checks are performed to see if  the DNA is correct. Cells whose DNA is damaged are either repaired or destroyed.  Cells can be signalled to commit suicide in a process called apoptosis.  
Cancer is a par'cularly pernicious muta'on as it func'ons by Preventing cell death and  allowing for Uncontrolled division. Cancerous cells can separate from the tumour and  move throughout the body to grow in other loca'ons.
