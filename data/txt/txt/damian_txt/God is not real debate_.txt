Introduction


Definition of God:
An immaterial being that is All Powerful, All Knowing, and Everywhere at once that supposedly created us.

Notes:

If God is real, with evidence from the Bible, and the Bible claims God exists, then any story with a god in it, is true.

Greek mythology was used to fill stuff they didn’t know, so God is used also to fill things that they don’t know

How did God become created?

What makes christianity true and other religions false?


Why can’t God prove himself to everyone right now? If he is real, He should be able to prove that he exists, and the absence of God revealing himself


Is God all powerful? Can he lift a rock that he created that he cannot lift



The Ontological argument, The Cosmological argument, The Teleological argument, and The Moral argument.


Ontological: god is a being greater then which can not be conceived 

Cosmological: That the world is perfect for life, and the universe has so many different aspects to it, that only a God could make a perfect universe capable of sustaining life.



Teleological: The design argument. The nature’s complexity, design, order and purposefulness can only be explained by a “designer”

Moral: That because we have morals, and morals do not spontaneously arise, it must have come from God, as there is no logical explanation of why morals would arise.


Counter arguments:

Cosmological counter argument: If the world is perfect, why do bad things such as cancer happen, or bodily imperfections? You do not have proof that life could not be sustained on other planets either.

Teleological counter argument: Just because the way nature works is orderly, doesn’t mean that a supernatural cause is behind it. Even though it looks orderly, it isn’t. We see order when there is none. There cannot be a God behind nature because there isn’t any order. The world is full of disorder that is clearly not being held by a God.

Moral counter argument: We evolved to have compassion, and morals, not because a divine creator gave us these morals, but because it was beneficial for survival in prehistoric times. No longer would an injury mean certain death.  

Arguments:

Note: Explain that the burden of proof is on the other side, by saying they have to explain that God exists, not that we prove that God does NOT exist. Negatives cannot be proved.

God is used in place of when people did not know what was happening. People did not know what caused lighting, so they believed God caused lighting to strike. Now we know what causes lighting to strike in certain places, so we no longer attribute it to God. 
(God of the gaps. What we cannot explain is attributed to a God.)

If God was indeed real, he should be able to prove it to us right now. Ask God to cause a specific, observable act, with video evidence, that cannot be repeatable by other means. If the conditions can be replicated, it is not an act of God.

If God is all-knowing, benevolent, and all-powerful, why did he make us have our own choices that ruin the world? Why did he make us unwise so that we would make bad decisions and sin. If God was real, then he did a bad job and is clearly not all knowing. Therefore he is not a real all-knowing God. He cannot be benevolent because he watches us die, murder and hurt each other constantly.

Introduction: damian

Hitler had once massacred millions of jewish people, war waged over the years and millions or even billions died because of it, if God was so loving and omnipotent why would he let this happen. Epicurus once said “Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?” God, just like other mythical beings, are just figments of our imagination, used to explain things that we used to not understand. There is no evidence for a God other than some scraps of unreliable paper. The events that happened in the bible might be real, but it could have been severely exaggerated and components added to show more evidence for their so-called holy being. The bible might just be real events that were just exaggerated, especially the resurrection. Spreading influence through exaggeration and lies is still done today. The Church does the same to spread its influence through a so-called God. Though the bible might seem real at a glance, such events could not be possible when tested by science. To believe that God exists is to believe that vaccines could cause autism, or a flat earth is indeed real, and we all know the latter is false. It is the job of our opposition to prove to you that God is indeed, real. The burden of proof lies on them, after all.

(Tl;dr: Define what God is, explain how that the bible is an unreliable source, and tell everyone that the job of proving God exists is on the other side. Not our own.)

Body:

First, God as a concept was created when people could not understand things. Before, it would be considered a work of God if lightning struck somewhere. Now, we know it is caused by a negative electrical charge in the cloud that jumps to the ground. God is no longer responsible for when lightning strikes, as we have explained it. This trend has been shown to continue, with previous so called acts of God, being proven to how it happens, with scientific evidence and reason. God is in the imagination, not in reality.

As well, if God was real, he should be able to prove it right now, right in front of us. God should be able, in some way, to prove to us that he indeed, is real. If God cannot prove to us that he indeed exists, then he does not.


Questioning:
Ontological argument questioning:

By using the ontological argument, you assume that God must exist, right?

If no: Then God doesn’t exist in the first place, and your argument has no point.

When your logic is explained clearly, it is that if God doesn’t exist, he would not be the most perfect being, and God is perfect? Am I right about your argument, if a bit general?

So your own statement proves itself?

Then it is considered faulty reasoning. It is circular reasoning after all.


Cosmological argument questioning:

If the conditions for life were not perfect, we would not exist to question it. Would you agree with that?

If no: Then we would not exist right now, had the conditions not been right, and we could not question it.

If yes: Then it's either by chance we are here, or a God created us. However, the world is not perfectly created. There is cancer, disease, and we commit atrocities on a daily basis. The sun could erupt solar flares destroying electronics all over the world. A meteorite could slam into the earth killing us all. Would a God, who is all powerful, all knowing, and benevolent, really create a world that could be destroyed so quickly?


Teleological argument questioning

So is this creationism, that an intelligent being created the universe?

If yes: Creationism has been proven to be false already, and so has intelligent design. Evolution has been proven far and wide. Irreducible complexity is merely a buzzword thrown around by creationists to defend their argument, such as the complexity of the eye. However, the eye does not have to be fully complete to serve a purpose. It could orient smaller animals towards the light, which gives it an evolutionary advantage, allowing natural selection to take place.

Moral argument:

No one is born with morals. Our morals are from the standard we grow up in, like laws. Would that be incorrect?

So our morals are artificially created by us, for us. God simply did not create these morals for us. When societies started to be made, they made rules. Those rules evolved into morals, and morals were coded into the laws those societies upheld. Our morals are corruptible, when society changes. Murder is against all of our morals, but when it was kill or be killed, those morals did not exist.



Summary: God is used for things we don’t understand. Why isn’t any other religion true? The world isn’t perfect, there are diseases and bad people. Order in the world doesn’t mean that there is a creator behind it. We evolved to have compassion and morals, God didn’t have anything to do with this. God should be able to prove himself if he were real. If he was real, why do bad things happen to innocent people? All of this proves that God cannot be real because he doesn’t do anything.

They believe there's lots of historical evidence behind God
God is a real God that is above all our status
Each religion has the same God
If you believe the bible you won't be like hitler
The people that believe in other religions also have a purpose
Our galaxy has 100 billion stars each with at least a planet orbiting it. And in our universe there are 2 trillion galaxies. So even with odds that low, it is not impossible for life to exist on other planets with the same conditions as earth. 

Meaning in life without religion can be found in the many familiar, meaning-conferring elements that aren't religious in nature. These include friends, family, romantic love, pets, good careers, personal projects, learning, teaching, noble causes, helping others, striving for moral excellence, notable achievements and experiences, hobbies and recreational activities, and so on. There are many non-religious sources of meaning in life, and it's in virtue of such things that life without religion can be meaningful.

It's also worth noting that life without religion can have purpose. We surely do need purpose in life in order to have a meaningful one; it's hard to imagine having a meaningful life without having a sense of purpose in it.

Sam Harris a neuroscientist and New york times bestselling author "The existence of a god is not necessary to explain the universe, the existence of consciousness, or the existence of morality." 

Our lives will end permanently some day, and they might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, but these things don't matter when it comes to having meaningful lives. All that matters is what our lives are like while they last. What matters is what we have, and what we do, and how these things affect us.

Lack of empirical evidence: There is no scientific or empirical evidence to support the existence of a deity.
Lack of proof: There is no definitive proof or evidence that a higher power or deity exists.
Alternative explanations: Many phenomena that were once attributed to a deity or higher power have since been explained by science and natural causes.
Personal beliefs: Whether or not a higher power exists is a matter of personal belief, and different people have different beliefs about the existence of a deity.
Contradictions: Some religious texts and beliefs may contain contradictions or inconsistencies, which can cast doubt on the existence of a deity.
The existence of evil and suffering: The existence of evil and suffering in the world is often cited as evidence against the existence of a loving and all-powerful deity.

"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?" - Epicurus (Ancient Greek philosopher who argued that the existence of evil and suffering in the world is inconsistent with the existence of a loving and all-powerful deity.)
"God is a being of terrific character - cruel, vindictive, capricious and unjust." - Thomas Paine (American political theorist who wrote that the concept of a deity is "contradictory and incomprehensible" and that belief in a deity is not necessary to explain the universe or human existence.)
"Faith means not wanting to know what is true." - Friedrich Nietzsche (German philosopher who argued that the concept of God is a human invention and that belief in a deity is detrimental to human progress and happiness.)
"The existence of a god is not necessary to explain the universe, the existence of consciousness, or the existence of morality." - Sam Harris (American neuroscientist and author who argues that the existence of a deity is not necessary to explain the universe, consciousness, or morality.)
"God is a thought who makes crooked all that is straight." - Friedrich Nietzsche 
"God is a concept by which we measure our pain." - John Lennon(British musician and member of the Beatles who wrote the song "Imagine," which includes the lyrics "Imagine there's no heaven / It's easy if you try / No hell below us / Above us only sky.")

If in the bible god just existed, can you explain how god just suddenly appeared 
Just like the big bang theory
