NAME OF CLUB/ORGANIZATION: Climbing club 


VISION/PURPOSE STATEMENT
Please provide a description of your club (in two paragraphs maximum).

Damian + Julien will run the climbing club with the support of Mr. Lao on the Fridays during the ssact block. The club is aimed at individuals who would like to exercise and those who enjoy rock climbing or wish to try. 


CONTRIBUTION TO PCA STUDENT LIFE
Please provide a detailed explanation about how this club will positively impact the PCA student community (in two paragraphs maximum).

This club will attempt to engage students through the challenging physical activity of rock climbing. Rock climbing not only gives students great physical exercise but also challenges their skills to view challenges in a different manner when faced with a difficult climb. This club will challenge studentsâ€™s skill and physical strength through climbs of multiple levels, making it a perfect fit for all.  

 
ORGANIZATION AND PLAN 
Outline how club meetings will be organized. Provide a sample schedule for one meeting.

The club will meet at 411 during the ssact block after the 5th period on Friday. Where we will walk as a group to the nearby rock climbing gym. Wavers would be sent out to people interested in the club and would need to be signed 2 days in advance. A $25 fee would be required for every session and will also need to be paid 2 days in advance. The money collected would go to Mr. Lao, where he would buy the day pass and rental equipment. All the transactions would be recorded in a spreadsheet to prevent any miscommunication and loss of transactions.
