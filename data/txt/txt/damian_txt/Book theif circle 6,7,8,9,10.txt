Questioner part 7
What do you think Liesel was feeling when she chose to read the Wisler out loud?
Liesel's decision to read aloud "The Whistler" during the air raid was probably a result of a mix of fear, desperation, and a need for connection. Reading aloud helped Liesel escape the turmoil and anxiety of the air raid, which was a horrific experience. Reading aloud helped Liesel to share her emotional connection with others around her because she probably had a strong emotional connection to the book and the characters in it. 
Was Liesel happy that she was able to keep taking books from the mayor or was she ashamed that she was caught stealing books? Do you think she will keep stealing books?
Liesel's love of books likely outweighed her fear of being caught, and she continued to steal books whenever she had the chance without thinking about the consequences it could have on their family.
Do you think Hans would have tried to help the man if he knew that it would cause him danger and to his family?
it's possible that Hans would have tried to help the man despite the danger, but it's also possible that he would have chosen to prioritize his family's safety if he was thinking clearly during the situation.
Would you try to do a good deed even if you would be punished for it if you were caught?
Whether or not I would try to do a good deed even if I knew I would be punished for it depends on the circumstances. I might be willing to take risks for the sake of doing what I believe is right if it doesn’t jeopardize my own safety and security or that of my family. Ultimately, it's a decision that depends on a variety of factors.

Sumuriser part 8: 
Rudy's father, Alex, refuses to let the Nazi soldiers take his son to a special Nazi training school due to his athleticism and intelligence. Hans, meanwhile, learns that his application to join the Nazi Party has been accepted and that he is being drafted into the German army. Rudy sets out walking, saying he wants to find and kill Hitler, but Liesel convinces him to turn back before they reach the edge of town. Hans is sent to Essen, Germany, to serve in the Air Raid Special Unit, which rescues survivors of air raids and collects the bodies of the victims. During one raid, an old man dies in Hans's arms, and he trips over the corpse of a young boy. Liesel wonders what's happening to Hans, Max, and Rudy's father and continues reading to Frau Holtzapfel. That winter, the parade of Jews continued. Rudy and Liesel ride their bikes ahead of one of the parades, scattering bread for the prisoners. When they are caught by a soldier, Liesel is kicked and told she doesn't belong there. Rosa gives Liesel a book that Max left for her, "The Word Shaker," which is a collection of sketches and stories Max wrote about his life and Liesel's. The first story describes Hitler realizing the power of words and determining to use them to control the world, and the second story also describes Hitler realizing the power of words and determining to use them to control the world. After reading the book, Liesel dreams of a tree and takes Rudy back to his father's suit shop, where they break in and steal a suit for Rudy. Rudy and Liesel almost kiss but don't.

Essayist part 9:
Discuss Rudy’s inner conflict about stealing. Talk about his preparations for stealing and how the commitment disappeared.

At the start of the book, Rudy steals several things, including apples and potatoes, to support his family, who are struggling financially. Nonetheless, as the plot advances, Rudy becomes increasingly conflicted about his behavior. For instance, when he and Liesel take some books from Frau Hermann's library, Rudy feels remorseful and ashamed, even though he adores books and is eager to read them. 

Rudy's uncertainty about thievery is also evident in his preparations for a major heist, which involves breaking into the home of a wealthy neighbor and stealing some of their prized possessions. At first, Rudy is thrilled about the idea, but as the day of the heist approaches, he begins to have second thoughts. He even tries to back out of the plan, but Liesel persuades him to go ahead with it.

But during the heist itself, Rudy's commitment to the plan evaporates entirely. When they enter the house, Rudy is overwhelmed by the wealth and luxury surrounding him, and he comes to the realization that stealing is morally wrong. He adamantly refuses to take anything and urges Liesel to leave with him. Eventually, Liesel follows Rudy's lead, and they escape without taking anything. 

Rudy's change of heart regarding thievery is a pivotal moment in the novel. It demonstrates that he is capable of making ethical decisions and possesses a firm sense of morality, despite his playful demeanor. Moreover, it strengthens his bond with Liesel, as they both learn to navigate their internal struggles and make choices based on their individual values and beliefs.


Literary luminaries part 10: 

Chapter 84
“It was explained to me that in the end, Michael Holtzapfel was worn down not by his damaged hand or any other injury, but by the guilt of living. In the lead-up to his death, the girl had realized that he wasn’t sleeping, that each night was like poison….Liesel write that sometimes she almost told him about her own brother, like she did with Max, but there seemed a big difference between a long-distance cough and two obliterated legs…” 

It draws attention to the psychological burden that wartime experience left Michael Holtzapfel with. It also demonstrates how Liesel, the main character, struggles to comfort him despite not completely realizing the extent of his suffering. It is crucial to the plot because it exemplifies the terrible toll that war takes on people, especially on those who suffer just psychological suffering rather than physical wounds. It also underscores the value of empathy and personal connection through difficult and tragic times.

Chapter 88 
"She leaned down and looked at his lifeless face and Leisel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees and in the glow of the anarchist's suit collection. She kissed him long and soft, and when she pulled herself away, she touched his mouth with her fingers...She did not say goodbye. She was incapable, and after a few more minutes at his side, she was able to tear herself from the ground. It amazes me what humans can do, even when streams are flowing down their faces and they stagger on..." 
 
It is a significant moment of emotional realization and growth for the protagonist, Rudy's death also represents a loss of innocence and a stark reminder of the brutal realities of war and human cruelty. We are often confronted with situations where humans have caused great harm to each other. Wars, genocides, and other forms of violence can leave us feeling despair and hopelessness. However, this reminds us that despite these horrors, there are also acts of kindness, love, and compassion that can make a difference.

Epilogue - the hand over man
it highlights one of the major themes of the story: the impact of humanity on each other, both good and bad. The narrator, Death, has witnessed the best and worst of humanity throughout the book, and this quote is a reflection of his feelings towards it. Throughout the book, Liesel's love of books and stories is a source of comfort and solace for her. This underscores the idea that stories can help us make sense of the world, connect with others, and find hope in difficult times. Storytelling has always been an important part of human culture. Stories can be used to inspire, educate, and entertain, and they can help us understand the experiences of others. In times of crisis, stories can also provide comfort and a sense of connection.


The end of the world part 1
It foreshadows the tragic ending of the book and prepares readers for the emotional impact of Liesel's death. By mentioning the rain and the dripping sky, the narrator creates a sense of foreboding and melancholy that permeates the final chapters of the book.
