Fee-Fi-Fo-Family: The Giant’s Side of the Story
You think you know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. But let me tell you, from where I’m standing—thousands of feet in the air—the real story is a whole lot different!
You’ve heard the story a thousand times: a brave boy named Jack, a magical beanstalk, and a terrifying giant who thunders “Fee-fi-fo-fum” as he chases Jack down the stalk. But what if I told you that’s not how it really happened? Jack? He wasn’t a hero—he was a thief. And me? I wasn’t some fearsome monster. I was just a father trying to protect what mattered most—my family.
Sit back because it's time for you to hear my side of the story, the real story of what happened when that boy climbed up the beanstalk.
You might imagine I lived in a stormy, dark castle filled with bones and gold coins piled high. Nope. I lived a peaceful life, high in the clouds, with my wife and kids. Sure, we’re bigger than you folks down there, but that didn’t make us monsters. In fact, our life was a lot like yours, just...bigger. I spent my days farming magical crops and tending to enchanted treasures that had been passed down through my family for generations.
My wife and I built a home we could be proud of. Sure, it wasn’t perfect—imagine trying to find furniture that can hold up to two tons of weight! Let me tell you, broken beds and collapsed chairs were a regular occurrence in our house. And don’t get me started on the size of kitchen utensils. A regular spoon for us is like a shovel for you! But despite these… let’s call them “big” challenges, we were a happy family. Our magic hen laid golden eggs each morning, providing for us in ways you wouldn’t believe. And the golden harp, oh, it wasn’t just any harp—it was a gift from my grandmother, handed down through generations. Every time it played, it filled our home with music that was unlike anything you’ve ever heard.
Life in the clouds wasn’t easy, but it was peaceful, and we were content. Then, out of nowhere, Jack appeared.
One day, as I was finishing my daily chores, something strange happened. I heard a rustling near the beanstalk. I went to investigate, and what did I find? A boy—no more than a scrawny human child—poking around in our home. Now, I’m a reasonable giant. At first, I thought he was lost. “Poor kid,” I said to myself, “probably got confused and somehow ended up in the clouds. Happens to the best of us, right?”
But Jack wasn’t lost. He wasn’t scared, either. Instead of asking for help or explaining himself, he started snooping around like he owned the place. I thought it was strange, but I didn’t worry too much—until I saw him heading straight for our treasures. The first thing he grabbed was one of the golden eggs from our hen, and if that wasn’t bad enough, he went for the golden harp next. Now, that harp wasn’t just any old object. It was a family heirloom, a priceless relic from my grandmother. It had been in the family for generations, a symbol of love and tradition. Jack, though? He didn’t care. He was greedily stuffing it into his sack like a common thief.
You see, from where I was standing, Jack wasn’t a hero. He was a thief—plain and simple. And those treasures? They weren’t just shiny things to us. They were our livelihood, our history. Imagine someone breaking into your house and stealing your grandmother’s wedding ring or your family’s only source of income. Would you let them get away with it?
Of course, I did what any father would do. I chased him. Now, I know how this part of the story goes in the human world: “Fee-fi-fo-fum,” I’m supposed to have said, sniffing for the “blood of an Englishman.” But let me tell you, that’s a load of nonsense. I wasn’t looking to eat anyone. I chased him because he was running off with my family’s treasures!
And sure, I’m a giant, so when I run, the ground shakes. But can you blame me? I’m not exactly built for speed. Every step felt like I was about to topple over, and let’s not forget that beanstalk. Do you know how hard it is to keep your balance when you’re that big and the only thing between you and a long fall is a skinny vine? I nearly tripped over that thing twice!
I called out, but it wasn’t some bloodthirsty roar. Honestly, I was just trying to catch my breath. Have you ever tried chasing a boy down a beanstalk when you weigh more than a small house? Trust me, you’d be out of breath too. I was desperate, yes, but not for blood—just for Jack to stop before he ruined everything. I even tried to reason with him: “You don’t understand! That harp—it’s priceless to my family!” But Jack didn’t hear me, or if he did, he didn’t care.
From my perspective, I wasn’t a monster hunting a human boy. I was a father trying to protect what was mine. But Jack saw it differently. He saw a giant, lumbering after him, and in his fear, he made me out to be the villain. All the while, I was just trying to stop a burglar from wrecking my life.
Things went from bad to worse when Jack reached the bottom of the beanstalk. In his rush to escape, he dropped some of the treasures he had stolen. The noise echoed through the clouds, and the beanstalk trembled under his weight. Then, before I could even think, the beanstalk snapped. The whole thing came crashing down. And me? I went tumbling with it.
Now, let me ask you—how could I possibly be blamed for the destruction that followed? I didn’t plant that beanstalk. I didn’t ask for it to grow right into my home! But when I crashed down to the ground, the villagers below didn’t see a confused giant who had just lost everything. No, they saw a monster. The beanstalk landed on homes, gardens were flattened, and the townsfolk were furious. They blamed me for the destruction, as if I had come down to wreak havoc on their village.
But think about it—if Jack hadn’t stolen from me, none of it would have happened. If he hadn’t run, the beanstalk wouldn’t have come crashing down, and their homes would still be standing. Instead, they pointed their fingers at me, the “evil” giant, when all I had done was try to stop the boy from ruining my family’s future.
So there you have it. Jack wasn’t the brave, noble hero you’d heard about. He was a greedy thief, stealing from a family who had done nothing to him. And me? I wasn’t the monster in this story. I was just a father trying to protect what was mine. But in the end, because of a misunderstanding, I became the tale's villain. The townspeople never heard my side, and even now, Jack is remembered as the brave boy who outwitted the giant.
But let me tell you something—there are always two sides to every story. Next time you hear about Jack and his beanstalk, remember: heroes aren’t always what they seem, and villains are often just people (or giants) in the wrong place at the wrong time. Misunderstandings can turn innocent intentions into disasters, and in the end, it’s not the size of a person (or giant) that determines their character. It’s their actions.
Morals:
​​The fractured version of this story shows several key morals. The story focuses on how there are always two sides to every story—what might seem heroic or villainous depends on perspective. Misunderstandings can have serious, far-reaching consequences; Jack’s misinterpretation of the Giant’s intentions leads to chaos and destruction. The tale also teaches that it’s not size or appearance that defines someone’s character, but their actions and intentions. Even a giant can be a loving father, and even a boy can be a misguided troublemaker.
How the story was fractured:
This retelling of Jack and the Beanstalk fractures the original by shifting the narrative perspective to the Giant. Instead of being the menacing villain, the Giant is shown as a misunderstood, caring father who is simply protecting his family’s treasures from a reckless intruder. Jack, traditionally the hero, is reframed as a thief who breaks into the Giant’s home, turning the classic "good versus evil" tale into one about misunderstandings and unintended harm. By focusing on the Giant’s side of the story, the retelling reveals a different narrative where motives and actions aren’t so black and white.
