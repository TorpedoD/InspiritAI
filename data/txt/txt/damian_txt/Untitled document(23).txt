The cause of WW1 was mainly because the stronger countries were power hungry, and wanted control and dominion over the other countries and become the no.1 power house. There were many different categories of how countries pursued this race of power, mainly imperialism, militarism, alliances, and nationalism. Imperialism is using bruteforce and using military or economic control to expand their territory. Both Britain, France, Austria Hungary, Germany, and Russia were imperial powers. Militarism is the opposite, as they use military and economic powers to defend themselves from the larger countries.
