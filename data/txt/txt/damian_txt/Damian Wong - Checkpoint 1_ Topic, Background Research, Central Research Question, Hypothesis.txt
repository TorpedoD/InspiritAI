Purpose of the Study:
The purpose of the study was to investigate the impact of branding on consumer choice, specifically focusing on how branding on packaging guides consumer attention and recognition in the retail environment. The study aimed to explore how branding influences decision-making processes by drawing attention to certain brands and aiding consumers in recognizing familiar brands.

Hypothesis:
The hypothesis of the study likely revolved around the idea that branding on packaging plays a significant role in influencing consumer behavior. It may have hypothesized that reducing branding on packaging would lead to a decrease in consumer attention and recognition of specific brands, while increased non-branded information could impact consumer choice differently.

Research Done or Test Conducted:
The research involved manipulating branding elements on packaging within a retail context using lab-based, computerized tasks. The experiments were designed and conducted to academic standards at the Multimodal Laboratory in The Department of Cognitive, Perceptual, and Brain Sciences at University College London. The study examined the effects of reduced branding on consumer choice and increased non-branded information on decision-making processes.

Analysis:
The analysis likely involved comparing data related to consumer behavior when branding on packaging was reduced versus when non-branded information was increased. The study may have assessed how these manipulations influenced consumers' ability to recognize and find brands they were looking for, shedding light on the importance of branding cues in guiding consumer choice in retail settings.

Trends in School Shootings
There were 318 school shootings at K-12 schools from the 2009-10 school year through the 2018-19 school year. 
The number of school shootings has been increasing in recent years. Prior to 2018, the number of incidents had never reached 60 in a given year, but the number of incidents in 2023 was about six times that threshold.
Between 2018 and 2023, there were more than 1,200 school shooting incidents in the U.S., resulting in over 1,000 victims. 

Characteristics of School Shootings
About half of the school shootings were committed by current or former students.
Suburban and rural, wealthier, and low-minority schools had more school-targeted shootings, which were the most fatal. 
Urban, poor, and high-minority schools had more shootings overall, but these were often motivated by disputes and committed by non-students or unknown shooters. 
More shootings happened outside school buildings, but those inside schools were usually more deadly. 

Link Between School Discipline and Shootings
The GAO found no empirical research from 2009-2019 that directly examined the link between school discipline approaches and school shootings. 
Experts say it is difficult to isolate the effect of any single factor due to the complex and multifaceted nature of violence.

Enrollment Declines
School shootings lead to decreases in student enrollment, particularly in 9th grade, as families may choose to send their children to other schools perceived as safer. However, families with children already attending school are more likely to keep them enrolled, rather than transfer them to a new school.
Deadly school shootings lead to lower test scores in the years following the event. This effect is not just due to changes in the student population, but also impacts the academic performance of individual students.
School shootings do not appear to affect behavioural outcomes like graduation rates, attendance, and suspensions.
Students and staff who witness school shootings are likely to suffer from traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and concerns about safety. Even short-term impacts from school shootings can severely disrupt academic achievement and social-emotional development.
The effects of school shootings extend beyond the school, impacting the entire community and relationships between families, the school, law enforcement, and local government.
In summary, the research shows that school shootings have significant negative impacts on student enrollment, academic performance, and the overall school climate and community, with lasting consequences for those affected.

Purpose:
The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of school mass shootings in the United States from 2017-2022. The researchers sought to examine how these traumatic events affect student enrollment, academic performance, and broader community-wide outcomes.

Hypothesis:
The researchers hypothesized that school mass shootings would lead to decreases in student enrollment, particularly in 9th grade, as families may choose to transfer their children to other schools perceived as safer environments. They also hypothesized that these shootings would result in lower standardized test scores in the years following the events. The researchers believed this effect would be due to both changes in the student population as well as direct impacts on the academic performance of individual students who experienced the trauma.

Research Conducted:
The study analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Education as well as other national databases to examine 34 school mass shooting incidents that occurred between 2017-2022. The researchers looked at enrollment figures, standardized test scores, graduation rates, attendance records, and suspension data before and after these tragic events.

Analysis:
Enrollment Declines: School mass shootings led to significant decreases in student enrollment, with the largest impacts seen in 9th grade. This suggests that many families chose to transfer their children to other schools perceived as safer options. However, families with children already attending the affected schools were more likely to keep them enrolled rather than transfer them.
Academic Performance Declines: The study found that deadly school shootings resulted in lower standardized test scores in the years following the events. Importantly, this effect was not solely due to changes in the student population. The researchers also observed direct negative impacts on the academic performance of individual students who experienced the trauma of the shooting.
No Behavioural Impacts: Interestingly, the analysis did not find any significant impacts on behavioural outcomes such as graduation rates, attendance, and suspension rates. This suggests the primary effects of school mass shootings may be on academic achievement rather than broader student behaviours.

Purpose:
The primary purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive, longitudinal analysis of the frequency and characteristics of school shootings in the United States over a 25-year period from 1997-2022.
The researchers sought to document the scale and scope of the problem of gun violence in schools in order to inform policy discussions and prevention efforts.

Hypothesis:
The study did not explicitly state a formal hypothesis to be tested.
Rather, the researchers approached this as a descriptive analysis to catalogue and examine trends in school shootings during this time frame.

Research Conducted:
The researchers utilized data from two national databases on gun violence incidents:
The Centre for Homeland Defence and Security's K-12 School Shooting Database
The Naval Postgraduate School's Centre for Homeland Defence and Security's K-12 School Shooting Database
These databases contain complementary information on school shooting incidents, allowing the researchers to compile a comprehensive dataset.
The researchers reviewed each incident in the databases to verify the details and categorize the events as school shootings or school mass shootings.

Analysis:
The researchers analyzed the combined dataset to identify trends and patterns in the frequency, location, and characteristics of school shootings and school mass shootings from 1997-2022.
Frequency of incidents:
The researchers identified a total of 1,149 school shooting incidents in the United States from the 1997-1998 school year through the 2021-2022 school year.
The frequency of school shootings has increased significantly over the 25-year period, with the number of incidents per year rising from an average of 19 in the early 2000s to over 60 in recent years.
Geographic Distribution:
School shootings have occurred in 40 states across the country, with the highest concentrations in states with larger populations like California, Texas, and Florida.
However, no region of the U.S. has been spared, with school shootings occurring in both urban and rural areas.
Incident Types:
The majority of school shooting incidents (around 60%) involved intentional shootings, either targeted attacks or indiscriminate violence.
The remaining incidents were accidental discharges of firearms or suicides that occurred on school grounds.
Casualties:
In total, the 1,149 school shooting incidents resulted in 356 fatalities and 1,025 injuries.
School mass shootings, defined as incidents with 4 or more victims shot, accounted for a disproportionate number of casualties, with an average of 9 deaths and 15 injuries per mass shooting event.


Research question: Exploring Post-Secondary Education Preferences Among Canadian Youth
How do Canadian high school students' perceptions of the safety and desirability of American universities change in the context of the increasing frequency of violence?

Hypothesis: 
The increase in the number and visibility of school shootings in the United States could influence how Canadian students perceive risks and choose universities, possibly making American schools less appealing as study options even when America can offer new opportunities.
