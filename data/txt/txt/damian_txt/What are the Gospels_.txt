The four gospels were written to provide four unique portraits of Jesus Christ
The synoptic Gospels have many common stories and similar languages. The Gospel of John provides a different style, much unique material, and a more theological presentation. 
The gospel genre may be identified as historical narrative motivated by theological concerns.  Ranch gospel writers had a particular purpose for writing and particular themes to develop. 
The gospels were written with reference to the need and concerns of the particular communities within the church, nut also with an eye toward their wider distribution among all the first century churches 
The gospels are best read “vertically,” following each narrative through the plot from beginning to end. The Holy Spirit inspired four distinct Gospels with their own unique themes and purposes 
Reading the Gospels “horizontally” comparing their accounts to one another enables the reader to see more clearly each Gospel’s particular themes and theology 
Harmonizing the Gospels into a single story risks distorting each Gospel writer’s unique contribution. Harmonizing is helpful, however, when seeking to answer historical questions about the life of jesus. 
Greco - Roman sources outside the New Testament provide very little additional information concerning the historical Jesus.
