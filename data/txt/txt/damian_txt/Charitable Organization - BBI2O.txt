The organization that I have chosen to research is the Mennonite Central Committee Ontario. It is an organization that's main purpose is to supply every human with basic human needs while sharing God’s grace and love. After watching “living off of one dollar a day” I saw that most people didn’t have a choice to be in that position that they are in. I chose this organization because I believe that we should give everyone a chance. A chance that can bring basic needs to people in need. This organization located in York, Ontario, has the ability to provide that. Being faith based such as our own school, they do their best to improve the lives of others as well as spreading the faith and Gospel of God. This organization is run by Rick Cober Bauman who holds the leadership position, as well as several other people in the board of directors. This is why I chose this organization.
