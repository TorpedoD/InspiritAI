Dramaâ€”Final Reflection

(1) What is the most important thing you learned this year?

This year, the most essential thing I learned was how to effectively project myself. This has greatly improved my confidence when giving speeches and helped to eliminate some of my stage fright. I've been able to present myself more clearly and assertively by improving my projection abilities, which has improved my capacity to communicate ideas in public contexts. One important lesson I've learned is the value of presenting without relying much on a script. This has allowed me to engage with my audience more truthfully. Moving away from a scripted method has taught me to use hand gestures and modify my voice levels, which has increased the impact of my presentations. Although I still face challenges when speaking in front of large audiences, the skills I've developed through this course have undoubtedly improved my ability to present myself effectively.

(2) What do you think is the most difficult part of being an actor?

I've realized that forgetting my lines is one of the most difficult aspects of performing. It's a circumstance that can easily knock me off balance and cause me to panic. When that dreadful time arrives and your mind goes blank, it is extremely difficult to improvise and remain cool, since the weight of the performance is now placed on your shoulders. Improvisation necessitates rapid thinking and imagination. In addition, a thorough comprehension of the character's goals, desires, and emotional state is required. You must be able to instantly connect to their brain, reacting truthfully to the circumstances unfolding before you. All of these factors influence how you react in the moment, reacting to the situation and finding a method to keep the scene running smoothly. The pressure to improvise can be overwhelming because there is no safety net of prepared dialogue to fall back on, which is why I believe improvisation is the most difficult aspect of being an actor. 

(3) Would you consider a career in acting? Why or why not?

A career in acting is not something I would consider. While I have a profound love for the art of acting and the power of storytelling, I understand that improvisation, the most challenging component of being an actor, presents a huge difficulty for me. Immersion in the realm of acting has shown my own limitations in terms of thinking rapidly on my feet. The ability to adapt, develop, and answer in the present is something I lack. The strain of forgetting lines, and the ensuing necessity to improvise, fill me with dread, apprehension, and immense doubt. When faced with the sudden blankness of my mind, I struggle to maintain composure and find the necessary creative flow to keep a scene alive. The thought of performing in front of large audiences intensifies my anxieties. While I have made strides in overcoming my fear of public speaking, there is still a part of me that finds it challenging to speak confidently and effectively before a substantial gathering. I believe that a career in acting would not be the best fit for me. My own limitations in improvisation and speaking in front of large audiences would hinder my ability. Given my deliberate and thoughtful nature, I find myself inclined to invest my efforts in a field that allows ample time for problem-solving.
