Systematic Theology, An introduction to Biblical Doctrine of Sin - Wayne Grudem 

 What is Sin? 

Any failure to conform to the moral law of God in act, attitude, or nature. 
           	
One example is given for sin from the 10 commandments (Exodus 24.17). What does it mean to covet ?  

God said thou shalt not covet. This means that you shall not desire to sin, to steal or to commit adultery 

Where did sin come from?  

It has always been us or an angel that chooses to sin, it is never god’s fault. But because of God’s omnipotence he would have known that we would voluntarily choose sin 

Sin is irrational  Prov 10.23

Did Adam’s sin have consequences for us?  What are two results of inheriting sin? 
Yes we inherited two tragic results, first we inherited guilt from adam, and we also have a sinful nature because of adam this means that there is sin within everyone 

      6a. In ourselves we totally lack spiritual good and are totally unable to do spiritual good.  

      6b. Are there degrees of sin? What is the example given? 

There are 2 examples, one is legal guilt and results in the world. It is wrong to covet my neighbor's car, but it is even more wrong to actually do it

7. What happens when a Christian sins?   (two things)  Rom 8.1, Eph 4.30, Heb 12.6

Our legal standing before god doesn’t change, we still go to heaven. However our fellowship with god is disrupted, and our christan life is damaged 

8. What kind of harm comes when we sin in our heart or with our bodies?  1 Peter 2.11


      There are spiritual harm that comes when we harbur sinful thoughts
