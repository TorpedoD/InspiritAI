Reflection 
I drew from multiple fields, like psychology and sociology, and elements from literature and art to craft compelling and relatable personalities based off of the personalities of the characters within TLT. When working on this quiz project for TLT novel adaptation I integrated insights from psychology (like coping strategies and leadership approaches) sociology (examining group interactions and character archetypes) mythology (using weapons and heroic figures) well, as pop culture elements (incorporating familiar music and heroes). This helped me capture the traits of each character effectively. Each quiz question, in this method, helped uncover a portion of the character's traits and behaviors; while catering to aspects of a reader's comprehension and promoting critical thinking skills actively involved in the learning process. Tools like quizzes like these children's literature become more approachable and captivating by involving readers in a narrative that resonates with their personal experiences and passions. This approach does not encourage a love for literature. Also nurtures an admiration for the depth and complexity of character-driven storytelling, across various fields of study.
