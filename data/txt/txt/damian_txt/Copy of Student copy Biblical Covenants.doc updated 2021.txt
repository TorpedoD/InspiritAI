John Walton video-key features of covenant include the goal of relationship.  God initiates the relationship by revealing himself to his people through the instrument of a covenant.  This includes God’s promises, some unconditional and some conditional.  These promises include benefits for his people and blessings.  The covenant needs cooperation and is ultimately for a right relationship with God  and could require cooperation.  

Biblical Covenants: The God who keeps his promises

Covenant is one of the most important concepts in the Bible.  It is found in our names for the parts of Scripture: Old and New Testament (testament is another word for covenant) and the word appears frequently (385 times in the OT and 33 in the NT). It refers to a Solemn             
Commitment.  God commits himself to his people by making binding promises.  Sometimes they are unilateral (God promises to act unconditionally) but often they are bilateral and condition: God expects his people to make their own promises to obey him.  The covenants are Sealed in blood and given with a sign that is designed to be a reminder of them.  

The Bible has one consistent concern: how can people know God and have a right relationship with him?  Central to that concern is the idea of “the covenant.” Biblical covenants are Initiated by God and agreed to by his people who could not amend or alter the terms.  There are many covenants in the Bible,  but we will highlight five major covenants.

	










﻿﻿Confidence: God's people know where they stand: God has pledged himself to them and he cannot go back on his word.
﻿﻿﻿Knowledge: God's grace initiates the covenant: they do not have to earn God's love.
﻿﻿﻿Purpose: God has selected them to be a special people with a special purpose.
﻿﻿﻿Reassurance: that God has built into the covenant a means by which we can be forgiven and make a fresh start.
