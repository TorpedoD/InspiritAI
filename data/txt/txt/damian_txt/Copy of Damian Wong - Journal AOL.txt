What social injustices can be seen in this film? Who holds the power, and who is the target of that power imbalance? What consequences might this have on the way Christianity is viewed by residential school survivors and their families?

	The Indian Act and residential schools are examples of the government’s acts of social injustice against the Indigenous. The Indian Act represents a legal instrument of control imposing legal discrimination intended to extinguish Indigenous traditions and identities. Residential schools separated Indigenous children from their families, attempted cultural genocide and caused un-erasable trama. In this power imbalance, the government had the authority to administer laws to enslave Indigenous people, who were the primary victims of the systematic discrimination that resulted in their marginalization. The consequence of such injustices is not simply felt through the suffering they incur; Christianity, which once had a caring nature and preached about loving one’s neighbour, would only be viewed as a lie with suspicion and distrust among the Indigenous people. 


How does watching the film add to your perception and reception of the ideas, happenings, and themes presented?

	After watching the short film "The Holy Angels," it opened my eyes to the experiences of people who survived the horrors of school, and I gained a deeper understanding of the seriousness of the issue. It was eye opening to see firsthand the impact of cultural genocide from the perspective of the victims. This film helped me spark reflections on how colonialism continues to affect communities, causing enduring pain. It also highlighted the importance of acknowledging and confronting dark history as a step towards healing and reconciliation. "The Holy Angels" helped to raise my awareness of these issues and created empathy for those who underwent school experiences and their families.

Socratic seminar reflection

Seminar #1
What did you learn from your peers during the seminar? How was the seminar overall? What did the class do well?

During the seminar, I found myself intrigued by the perspectives and interpretations of my classmates regarding the book. It was truly interesting to witness such a range of insights that shed light on aspects of the text I hadn't previously pondered. Each viewpoint taught me to ponder the underlying messages of each chapter from a completely new point of view, broadening my understanding of the chapters as a whole.

In general, the seminar was an experience that urged me to view the book and its implications from a different perspective. Although the session started off hesitantly and was very awkward, the seminar leader did a very good job of breaking the ice and getting the seminar started. As discussions started, I became increasingly engaged and eager to contribute while exploring the themes presented in the book.

Throughout the seminar, our class demonstrated outstanding skill, in building upon each other's ideas. As conversations progressed, my peers expanded on one another's insights, leading to a detailed analysis of the text. The questions and thoughts presented allowed for the building of different perspectives on an idea. This collaborative spirit does not only improve our understanding of the novel but also showcases the creativity of our class.



How can you help improve the discussion next time? 

I aim to improve discussions in the next seminar by posing questions that expand on my peers’ thoughts. By creating questions that encourage deeper thought on a topic while welcoming viewpoints, I hope to create engaging and cooperative discussions. 

What were your strengths? What are areas for improvement? What strategies can you use to help you reach your goals for improvement?

During the seminar, I found that one of my strengths lay in supporting my ideas with quotes and references from the book. I noticed that citing important parts of the book before the seminar made my arguments stronger and improved the discussion by grounding our ideas in the book. This skill helped me actively participate in the conversation while demonstrating a grasp of the material.

I also came to realize that I struggled with asking questions that could spark thinking and exploration of concepts. In the seminar, I found it challenging to come up with questions on the spot, which limited my ability to guide the discussion towards a deeper level. This hindered my capacity to facilitate a thoughtful exchange among my peers.

To address this challenge, I plan to have a new approach to formulating questions. I will take time before the session to brainstorm and create questions. Preparing these questions beforehand will enable me to refine them and ensure they are open ended. This method will help me avoid the pressure of thinking on the spot while enhancing my ability to steer discussions, towards a deeper level.

Seminar #2

What did you learn from your peers during the seminar? How was the seminar overall? What did the class do well?

During the seminar, my classmates' insightful questions encouraged me to delve into the text, making me reassess my understanding of concepts. Thanks to the questions and perspectives of my peers, I was able to approach the book with greater understanding and thoughtfulness. I realized the significance of examining topics from different angles and considering their implications.

This seminar was noticeably better than the previous one due to increased participation among classmates. The heightened engagement created a more diverse environment, allowing for a more open exchange of ideas and perspectives. This seminar had more effective links from current situations and issues to the book, improving our discussions. By integrating concerns with the themes of the text, my peers added fresh and insightful ideas that enhanced our grasp of its relevance and importance.

My peers did a wonderful job in demonstrating their understanding of the book by supporting their arguments with well researched ideas and references while effectively tying these concepts back to the core themes of the chapters. These examples and textual analysis created an interesting exploration of the text, encouraging deeper involvement and discussion among the group. As more individuals joined in on the conversation, our collective understanding of the book expanded through different perspectives and understandings of the book. 



How can you help improve the discussion next time? 

In the seminar, I aim to improve our conversations by building upon the thoughts and perspectives shared by my peers. My goal is to add ideas and different perspectives to enhance our understanding of the subject matter. Through this, I can encourage a more inclusive atmosphere where my group is encouraged to express their thoughts and opinions. By promoting an open environment while considering differing perspectives, the next seminar can be more engaging and improve discussion.

What were your strengths? What are areas for improvement? What strategies can you use to help you reach your goals for improvement?

In the seminar, I found that my strength lies in offering perspectives backed up by examples, from the book. I often shared ideas that added depth to our discussions and posed questions that prompted my peers to think critically. By encouraging thought provoking discussions, I encouraged an exploration of the themes. Through this, I believed that I helped my peers consider different viewpoints.

However, I noticed a challenge with confidence in presenting my views during the seminar. I frequently felt hesitant or nervous, which affected my ability to express myself clearly, often with my voice fading out at the end of my idea. This lack of confidence resulted in points. Missed opportunities to contribute meaningfully to the dialogue.

To address this confidence issue and improve how I articulate my thoughts in seminars, I plan to engage in jotting down key ideas and thoughts as they arise during discussions. By capturing my ideas in time, I aim to maintain clarity and focus, preventing fragmentation or disjointed thinking. This practice will also help as a reference, for recalling points and core ideas that I want to communicate effectively.

Seminar #3
What did you learn from your peers during the seminar? How was the seminar overall? What did the class do well?

During our seminar, I learned a lot from the perspectives shared by my colleagues. Each person brought their own perspectives on the author and the book, offering ideas that I hadn't considered previously. Their suggestions helped me understand the text better and explore interpretations.

The seminar was the best one so far, surpassing previous seminars in terms of active participation and depth of discussion. All my classmates actively joined in, sharing their ideas and adding to the conversation. This high level of engagement created a high level conversation where many ideas were shared.

The class did well in generating a range of thoughts and opinions. Every classmate contributed to the discussion by introducing quality ideas or posing thought provoking questions that improved the discussion by a huge margin. The open setting within the group helped create more ideas and perspectives than the previous seminars. The session felt very inclusive and welcoming, allowing everyone to participate.


How can you help improve the discussion next time?
One way I can improve this seminar is by backing individuals who have not yet had the chance to voice their thoughts. By being attentive to those who haven't spoken up yet, I can create space for their perspectives to be heard and ensure that our conversations reflect a range of viewpoints. This could involve motivating quieter individuals to share their thoughts, encouraging them to engage in discussions or directly seeking their input on a matter. This approach can improve the conversation by enabling an plethora of opinions to be expressed.


What were your strengths? What are areas for improvement? What strategies can you use to help you reach your goals for improvement?

I demonstrated my strength by sharing my thoughts and opinions during our debate. I made sure to express myself effectively to my peers, ensuring that my ideas were well understood. By speaking up, I actively engaged in the conversation and added value to it. Whether by offering suggestions, asking questions or providing interpretations, I focused on making contributions that enhanced our discussion rather than making irrelevant comments.

I realized that I might have focused too much on expressing my views, potentially overshadowing others who hadn't had a chance to speak yet. While it's important for me to share my insights, I saw that it's equally important to create space for everyone's voices to be heard and respected. I may have unintentionally discouraged quieter individuals from participating, limiting the diversity of perspectives in our dialogue.

To address this in our next seminar, I can try to show interest in the different perspectives of those who haven't spoken much and actively encourage them to join our conversations. This creates an inclusive space by encouraging discussions and directly seeking input from quieter participants, on relevant topics, which can help ensure a more balanced exchange of ideas.
