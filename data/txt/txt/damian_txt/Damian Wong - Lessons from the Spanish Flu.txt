After reading the article found at the link above, write a short response to the following question: What lessons can we learn from the Spanish Flu pandemic that we can apply to the current Covid-19 pandemic?

Response: 
The lesson that we should have learned from the Spanish flu pandemic was that there was always a second wave. If people were educated on factual information from history, the death rate of covid 19 would not have been so bad. However once the first wave was over the government should have warned people of the second wave preventing the rapid spread of the second wave.
