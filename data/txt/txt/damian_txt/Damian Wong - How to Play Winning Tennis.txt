How to Play Winning Tennis		 by Brian Green

	As a tennis instructor for the past three summers, I have watched many people waste their money on hi-tech racquets, designer outfits, and professional lessons and then complain loudly that despite all the expense, they still can’t play the game.  Unfortunately for them, a decent backhand is one thing that money can’t buy.  No matter what player you are or what level you wish to be, there are four steps to achieving the goal of winning tennis.  They can be summed up in four words: basics, practice, concentration, and attitude.
All sports may be reduced to a few basic skills, which, if learned properly at the outset and drilled until they are instinctive, lead to success.  Tennis is no exception; however, few people seem willing to spend the time needed to master the basics.  Having been shown the proper grip and swing for a forehand, backhand, and serve, my students seem to feel that they can qualify for Wimbledon.  The basics are not learned that easily.  Many tennis schools are now using a system developed in Spain that helps new players establish the correct stroke.  For the first month of lessons, they aren’t allowed to use a tennis ball.  For that first month, correct positioning, proper swing, footwork, and technique are drilled without any of the distractions of keeping score, winning or losing, or chasing errant balls.  That’s how important the basics are to winning tennis.
	Having acquired the basics, a beginning player must now practice and practice and practice to remember and refine those important skills.  It isn’t very much fun sometimes to play against a ball machine that never swears or sweats and doesn’t care whether you hit a winning return.  Drills and exercises won’t do much for your social life while your friends are on the next court playing “pat-a-ball” with a couple of good-looking novices.  Those basic strokes that you must keep hitting correctly hundreds of times a day aren’t as impressive as the sexy spins and tricky between-the-legs shots the club players are perfecting…but if you’re going to play winning tennis, practice is vital.  Your feet must move instinctively to get you to the ball properly positioned for an effective stroke; a smooth backhand must become automatic from everywhere on the court; a crisp forehand, hit with accuracy, must be as natural as breathing.
	When you’re finally ready for competition, everything seems calculated to make you forget all you’ve learned.  It requires enormous concentration to shut out distractions and continue to practice the basics that are essential to your game: watch the ball, keep your head down, turn 90 degrees from the path of the ball, keep your feet moving, and so on and so on.  With an opponent opposite you, people watching, and your own self-esteem on the line, it’s difficult to keep your mind from wandering.  Tennis is about 50 percent mental effort.  Successful players are those who are able to block out distractions and concentrate on making the racquet meet the ball with precision.
	Finally, developing the proper attitude is the key to winning tennis.  I define winning tennis as playing the game to the best of your ability, hitting the ball as well as you know you can, and enjoying the feeling of practiced expertise.  Winning tennis has little to do with beating an opponent.  Naturally, if you learn the basics, practice sufficiently, and concentrate, you’ll win many matches, but that is the reward of playing well, not the reason for playing well.  People who swear and throw their racquets when they lose are very useful; they are the most satisfying players to trounce.  I don’t understand why they play a game that gives them such pain.  Tennis players who enjoy the feel of a well-hit ball and the satisfaction of a long, skillfully played rally are winners, regardless of the score.
