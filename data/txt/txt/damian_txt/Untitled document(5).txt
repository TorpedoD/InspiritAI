The Shape Sorter 

Once upon a time, in a town of shapes, there lived a circle. With smooth curves and no sharp edges, the circle stood out among the different shapes as the only one without a corner. 

At first, the circle wanted to be friends with the other shapes. It tried really hard to join in, but some shapes teased and laughed at it, even though most shapes didn't think it did anything wrong. The teasing made the circle feel sad and alone.

Day after day, the circle faced the pain of being different. He felt alone and isolated, wondering if he would ever find a place where he truly belonged.

One day, the teasing became too much to bear. Feeling desperate to escape the hurtful words and cruel laughter, the circle decided to change itself. It grabbed a chisel and began to chip away at its smooth surface, trying to create an edge like the other shapes.

As the circle chipped away at its side, it couldn't shake the feeling that it was losing a part of itself. But the thought of finally being accepted by the other shapes kept it going.

When the square, triangle, and other shapes with edges saw the circle's transformation, they were surprised. They had never seen anything like it before. Some of them felt sorry for the circle and wanted to help it, but they didn't know how.

But there were a few shapes who saw past the circle's attempt to change itself and recognized the sadness in its eyes. They knew that true friendship didn't depend on having edges, and they wanted to show the circle that it was accepted just the way it was.

But the circle found it hard to believe them and still felt very sad because the teasing hadn't stopped. Seeing the circle's continued sadness despite their words, the other shapes knew they had to show it firsthand. 

They took the circle to "The Shape Sorter," a special place where shapes of all kinds fit neatly into designated spaces. There, surrounded by squares, triangles, and more, the circle saw that no matter what shape they were, everyone ended up in the same spot. They all fit snugly into the same shape box, just like pieces of a puzzle coming together.

As the circle watched the different shapes slide effortlessly into place, it felt a warmth spreading through its heart. For the first time in a long time, it felt like it belonged.
