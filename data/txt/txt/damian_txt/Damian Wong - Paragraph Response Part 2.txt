Paragraph Response

Success criteria: I will write a thoughtful paragraph illustrating ideas from the book on a deeper level.

Instructions:

Using the paragraph note, write a detailed and thoughtful response to the following question: “How has Liesels character developed through part 2 of the story? What imagery and evidence from the text help communicate this ‘transformation?’” (10 marks)

Because of her exposure to and education about the Nazi era, Liesel's character evolves considerably in "The Book Thief" Part 2. She transforms during the story from a defenseless girl without literacy to a young adult who has experienced loss, cruelty, and the ugly realities of war. Her contact with reading aids in her personal development. Initially illiterate, Liesel develops a bond with Hans and Max that teaches her the value of language and the comfort it can provide in tough situations. The development of her relationships with Max, Hans, and Rudy serves as an example of how she learns to rely on others and develop lasting connections with those who are close to her.
