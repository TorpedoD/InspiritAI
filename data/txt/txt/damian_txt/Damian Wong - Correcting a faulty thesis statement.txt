Errors to avoid when composing a thesis


1. A thesis cannot be a fragment; it must be expressed in a sentence.

Better: Driving in winter can be very dangerous for new inexperienced drivers and pedestrians.

2. A thesis must not be in the form of a question. (Usually the answer to that question 
    could be the thesis).

Better: Eighteen should not be able to vote, because although they are adults they are still inexperienced and should not make rational decisions 

3. A thesis must not contain phrases as I think. (They merely weaken the statement)

Better: forest fires are the biggest danger facing our natural resources 

4. A thesis must not contain elements that are not clearly related.
Poor: All novelists seek the truth; therefore some novelists are good psychologists.
Better: novelist are good psychologists, because of their understanding of human character 

5. A thesis must not be expressed in vague language.
Poor: Power and privilege affect an individualâ€™s maturity.

6. A thesis must not be expressed in muddled or incoherent language.
Poor: All students should not think that university is for everyone, because for many people they 
         have a career that high school was all they needed. 

Better: university is not for everyone, as some situations high school is all most need to succeed in life 

7. A thesis should not be written in figurative language.

Poor: Love is the rose in the garden of our existence.

Better: Love is as important as knowledge in our existence.
