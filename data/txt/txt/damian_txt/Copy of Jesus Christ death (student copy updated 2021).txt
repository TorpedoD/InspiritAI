Jesus Christ’s Death 

Summary of Events Around Jesus Death: 
The evidence suggests that both Roman and Jewish authorities  were active participants in the arrest and trial of Jesus. The crucifixion ordered by Pilate was, and done by Roman soldiers. 
Pilate probably acted against Jesus to placate the temple leadership, to prevent a popular revolt, and to serve as a grim warning  against other troublemakers. 
The Jewish authorities probably acted against Jesus because he  threatened their influence among the people and because he directly  challenged their legitimacy as guardians of Torah 
The significance Jesus gave to his coming death can be discerned through his eucharistic words at the Last Supper and the ransom saying of Mark 10:45, both of which have strong claims to authenticity. Together these indicate that Jesus saw his death as a sacrificial death for the sins of his people, bringing spiritual freedom through a new exodus and establishing a new covenant relationship with God.
At his last supper, Jesus inaugurated a new Passover celebration  for the new age of salvation—the kingdom of God. 
Jesus carried his cross to the place of the skull where he was crucified. 
Jesus our Sacrifice: 
In one sense, to truly appreciate the significance of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross for a grade ten  student, today, we have to understand the Old Covenant (Old Testament) sacrificial system. Every year,  Jews would travel to the tabernacle/temple in Jerusalem to fulfill their religious obligation of sacrificing animals to cover their sin 
When Jesus came to earth, he came, in part, to be the final sacrifice for the sins of mankind. This is why  John the Baptist declared, upon seeing Jesus: “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the  world!” (Jn. 1:29) 
1. If the Old Testament sacrificial system covered over sins, how does John the Baptist foreshadow  that Jesus’ death would be a superior sacrifice? He takes away the sin of the world
Jesus: The “True” and “Better” Passover Lamb 
One particular sacrifice that was made by the Jews was the sacrificing of a Passover Lamb. The Jews had  spent 400 years as slaves in Egypt until God raised up Moses to be their deliverer. On the night before  their deliverance, the angel of death visited Egypt. Every home which did not have the blood of a lamb  over its door posts was visited by the angel of death and the first born in that household.  In the New Testament, one of Jesus’ titles is that of the “_______________.” This is significant because  Jesus is both the “firstborn of creation” and assumes the role of the sacrificial lamb. So Paul writes:  “Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.” (1 Cor. 5:7). 


Jesus: Our Substitute 
In both his life and his death Jesus functioned as our substitute. This is why I often say that, “Jesus  lived the life we should have lived and then died the death we should have died.” 
The substitutionary nature of his death is called: penal substitutionary atonement 
What is penal substitution? Penal refers to the awful state of the human race in Adam in which we stand under God’s judgment and the penalty of death. This one word captures a central feature of the Bible’s story: Adam, as the covenant head and representative of the human race, disobeyed God and his sin then became our sin by nature, imputation, and choice. All humanity is “in Adam” and therefore under the power and penalty of sin—namely spiritual and physical death (Rom. 3:23; 6:23; see Eph. 2:1-4). Substitution refers to the identity and work of Christ who not only acts with us but also for us by his cross. God redeems us by triune initiative and agency by the provision of a Substitute. As our new covenant head, Christ represented us in his life and death as the last/greater Adam who willingly and gladly obeyed the Father in perfection and by the power of the Spirit. In death, Christ stood in our place, took God’s demand for our righteousness upon himself, and paid our debt by receiving the penalty we deserved. (2Cor. 5:21; see 1Pet. 3:18; Gal. 3:13; Heb. 9:28; Rom. 8:32).  Of all the atonement theologies, it’s only penal substitution that captures the full richness of the biblical data and the God-centered nature of the cross.

                      RIGHTEOUSNESS         




The Apostle Paul highlights the reality of PSA in 2 Corinthians 5:21: “For our sake he made him to  be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”

The Accomplishments of Jesus’ Death 
reconcile : Jesus’ death reunites with God from whom we were previously alienated. In fact,  because of our sins we were formerly “objects of wrath” in the eyes of God! 
2. Phopitiation : Jesus’ death satisfies the wrath of God against sinners since that wrath was  poured out on Jesus. 
3.  ransom: Jesus’ death bought sinners back from the dominion of sin and death and ushered  them into the kingdom of God. 
Divine Child Abuse? 
Some have suggested that if God put his son on the cross and then poured out his wrath on his son for the  sins of others, this is comparable to Divine child abuse. Is it? 
1. No! The doctrine of the trinity affirms that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit have one will  and one agenda, though they are separate and distinct persons. So, the Father initiates the plan  of salvation; the Son accomplishes  the plan of salvation and the Holy Spirit APPLIES the  plan of salvation. The Father’s will is the exact same will as the will of the Son and the will of  the Holy Spirit.
