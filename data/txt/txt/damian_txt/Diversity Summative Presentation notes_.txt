Conceptualising anti-Asian racism in Canada during COVID-19 pandemic: A call for action to social workers by Kedi Zhao, Carolyn O’Connor, Trish Lenz and Lin Fang
Anti-Asian racism has “become more rampant” due to the COVID-19 pandemic
COVID-19 has exposed those who are racist towards asians
How can we combat anti-Asian racism? Social workers need to understand cultural policy, social context, and offer directions in order to help future social work research


Combating Anti-Asian Racism and Xenophobia in Canada: Toward Pandemic Anti-Racism Education in Post-COVID-19 by Shibao Guo and Yan Guo

Huge surge in racism and xenophobia across Canada towards Asian Canadians, particularly Chinese, because of the COVID-19 pandemic
Discriminiation is deeply rooted in Canada throughout our history
Asian Canadians have historically been painted as “biologically inferior, culturally backward, and racially undesirable”
Combating and eliminating racism will take anti-racism education



Beyond Pain and Outrage: Understanding and Addressing Anti-Black Racism in Canada by Johanne Jean-Pierre and Carl E. James

The wave of protests that followed the death of George Floyd is less about “the pain, anger and grief” of Black people, but more about how the images of the policeman’s knee in the neck of George Floyd for 8:46 seconds—while bystanders looked on—resonate with our own experiences of dehumanization (Owusu-Bempah 2017). Metaphorically, the "knee in the neck" represents not only police brutality but the historic and contemporary colonial institutions that help to uphold white supremacy and anti-black racism. (From paper) This connects to the book Dear Martin, in which the victim experiences violence from police.
“Yet, research has shown that racist stereotypes (Creese 2019; James 2012), racism related stress (James et al. 2010), and historic and contemporary structural barriers affect Black Canadians across regional, linguistic, immigrant, and/or socioeconomic status groups (United Nations Human Rights Council 2017).” (From paper) This shows that racism is still a prevalent issue that Black Canadians from various walks of life must deal with. In the novel, Dear Martin, this is shown when Manny is killed even though he is a richer and “well off black teen. 


Acute Discrimination and East Asian-White Mental Health Gap during COVID-19 in Canada by Cary Wu, Rima Wikes, Yue Qian, and Eric B Kennedy
A Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice survey of 1,130 adults in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal found that 14 % of respondents were concerned that “all Chinese or Asian people carry the coronavirus” and that 20% did not think that “it’s safe to sit next to an Asian or Chinese person on a bus who is not wearing a mask.” (From paper) This is evidence of prejudice and misconceptions to Asians because of what they hear about COVID-19 originating from Asia.
Due to higher incidents of discrimination towards East Asian Canadians, there is a higher level of poor mental health symptoms compared to white Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic

Aftermath of murder of George Floyd:
Minneapolis police officers arrested George Floyd on may 25
George Floyed was a 48 year old black man that got arrested because a shop owner said he bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill
17 min after the first squad of police officers arrived at the scene he was on the ground life less
“Video evidence shows officers taking a series of actions that violated the policies of the Minneapolis Police Department and turned fatal, leaving Mr. Floyd unable to breathe, even as he and onlookers called out for help.” 
The officer, Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on Mr. Floyd’s neck for at least 8 min and 15 seconds. Even after Mr. Floyed lost consciousness he still kept his knee on his neck for a full 1 min and 20 sec.
The officer was charged with 3rd degree murder, however that did not stop the spark that lead up to the protest in canada


Protest: Protest proves that there is an issue on racism
“Anti-racism demonstrators gathered at multiple sites across Canada on Saturday in protest of the death of George Floyd and systemic racism and police violence against Black people.”
Canadians gathered around in the thousands to protest the lost black lives in the hands of police
“Thousands of demonstrators chanting "I can't breathe" and "Enough is enough" flooded through downtown Ottawa on Friday afternoon, demanding an end to police brutality and anti-black racism.”
Due to the protest around Canada and in the U.S, police chiefs all around Canada publicly apologised to the public and even took a knee. 
“​​Minneapolis on Friday banned chokeholds and neck restraints by police and now requires officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force.”

Connection to the “Dear Martin”

This novel is surrounded by aspects of race and racism. Our main character, Justyce, faces racism directly and indirectly. Justyce faced many issues because of the colour of his skin. These issues ranged from racial biases and hateful comments to unjust arrests and being shot at. In this novel, he struggles with finding his identity within and outside of his race. The events in this novel are based on real life events. This shows how real these issues are and show the importance of understanding diversity in real life.

Change in society:

Over the years, racism has not left our society, rather it has manifested in different ways. For example, slavery is no longer a widely accepted trade which is a positive but microaggressions and acts of violence still occur which is negative. I believe that there has been the most improvement in terms of recognizing problems with racism and lack of diversity rather than an overall decrease in racism. 





Personal Insight:

We learned that living with diversity is not simply to not cause harm to people that have different characteristics, race, or other features than us. Rather, it is to make other groups of people feel comfortable and included by you and people similar to you. 
We also learned that creating more inclusion and diversity is about keeping ourselves educated about different cultures. Keeping our own biases and prejudices in check is what is most important.

The thing that surprised us the most was how Canada, which is known for its diversity, still has problems with racism. 
Something else that was surprising was how quickly things can escalate from yet another case of unfair racism and police brutality to world wide protests and public outrage.
Our perspective on diversity changed as we began to concern more for ways to protect being able to live with diversity in our community peacefully.
Being inclusive isn’t just about accepting those who are different but participating in other cultures and striving to understand them.
