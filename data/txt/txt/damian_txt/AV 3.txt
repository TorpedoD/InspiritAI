"Reign In Us"

Vs 1
You thought of us before the world began to breathe
And you knew our names before we came to be
You saw the very day we'd fall away from you
And how desperately we need to be redeemed

PC: 
Lord Jesus come lead us
We're desperate for your touch

[Chorus:]
Oh Great and Mighty One, with one desire we come
That you would reign, that you would reign in us
We're offering up our lives, a living sacrifice
That you would reign, that you would reign in us

Vs 2:
Spirit of the Living God fall fresh again
Come search our hearts and purify our lives
We need your perfect love, We need your discipline
We're lost unless you guide us with your light

Bridge 1
For your love to refine us cry out
For your love to define us cry out
For your mercy to keep us blameless until you return


Bridge: 2
So reign, please reign in us
Come purify our hearts we need your touch
Come cleanse us like a flood and send us out
So the world may know you reign, you reign in us


NEW WINE

[Verse 1]
In the crushing, in the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I, now surrender
You are breaking new ground

[Pre-Chorus]
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand
When I trust You, I don't need to understand

[Chorus]
Make me Your vessel, make me an offering
Make me whatever You want me to be
I came here with nothing but all You have given me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me

[Verse 1B
In the crushing, in the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil I, now surrender
You are breaking new ground
You are breaking new ground

tag
Jesus, bring new wine out of me
Jesus, bring new wine out of me

[Bridge]
Cause Where there is new wine There is new power
There is new freedom and The Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames To carry Your new fire today
