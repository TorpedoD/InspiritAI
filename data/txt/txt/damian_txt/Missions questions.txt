Q1. Describe why you're applying for this particular project?

I am applying for this project because I want to deepen my relationship with God, who has guided and supported me throughout my life, and to grow in my faith. When I first came to PCA two years ago, I was searching for both faith and meaningful friendships. Although I was a Christian, I felt disconnected from God and was struggling with depression, questioning both my faith and my beliefs. Deep down, I knew that PCA could provide a safe space for me to explore these questions. Since then, the loving environment at PCA has helped me feel the Lord’s presence again.

Now, my hope is to discover the purpose God has for me and, in turn, help others who are lost in the same way I once was. This desire grew even stronger when I saw a close friend going through the same struggles I had faced, and I could see the pain in him. I want to be able to guide him back to the Lord, and I believe that strengthening my own faith will enable me to help others experience the same grace and love that I have found through PCA.

Q2. From what you understand, what is the purpose for missions trips?

From what I understand, the purpose of mission trips is to serve others while sharing God’s love and message with those who may not know Him. It’s about stepping outside of our comfort zones to help communities in need, not just through words but through actions that reflect Christ’s teachings—whether that’s building homes, teaching, or simply offering support. At the same time, mission trips offer a chance to grow spiritually, as we learn to rely on God more deeply, build meaningful connections with others, and reflect on the purpose He has for us in serving His kingdom. Ultimately, it's about making a positive impact both physically and spiritually, bringing hope and faith to others while growing in our own journey with God.

Q3. Explain as clearly as possible what the gospel is. How would you share it with someone unfamiliar with it?

The gospel is the good news of God's love for humanity, shown through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. It tells us that, despite our flaws and mistakes (which the Bible calls sin), God loves us so much that He sent His only Son, Jesus, to take the punishment for our sins. Jesus lived a perfect life, died on the cross, and rose from the dead three days later, proving that He has power over sin and death.

Through His sacrifice, Jesus made a way for us to be forgiven and have a restored relationship with God. If we believe in Him, accept His forgiveness, and follow Him, we receive eternal life with God and the strength to live with purpose and love, as God originally intended.

If I were sharing this with someone unfamiliar with it, I would explain that it’s a message of hope and grace. It’s not about being perfect or earning God’s love, but about accepting that we all need help and that God has provided that help through Jesus. I would emphasize that the gospel offers forgiveness, new life, and a relationship with a loving God who is always there for us.

Q4. what strengths and skills would you bring to a team if you were selected

I would bring several strengths and experiences to the team if selected. Having lived and studied in China, Japan, and Canada, I’ve been exposed to a range of different cultures, which has given me a unique perspective on how to connect with people from various backgrounds. This global experience helps me understand and relate to others on a deeper level, especially when they are going through struggles or facing uncertainty. Growing up with a large family has taught me how to listen and support others, as I've often seen family members dealing with personal challenges. These experiences have allowed me to develop a heart for helping people through difficult times, and I’ve been able to apply this by guiding my friend and some family members as they explore their relationship with Jesus. I believe my empathy, cultural understanding, and genuine care for others would contribute meaningfully to the team.

Q5. what are areas you hope to grow in as a result of being on this team?


I hope to grow in several areas by being part of this team. First, I want to improve my ability to share the gospel effectively. I’ve seen how much my life has transformed after developing a stronger relationship with Jesus, and I want to communicate that joy and peace to others more confidently. Learning to articulate my faith and testify to God’s presence in my life is something I’m eager to develop, as I know it could impact others the way it has impacted me.

Additionally, I hope to gain more clarity on the purpose God has for me in this world. Being part of this mission will challenge me to trust in His plan and seek direction for how I can best serve His kingdom. Through this experience, I want to deepen my faith, grow spiritually, and learn how to use the gifts God has given me to bless others, whether through outreach, support, or simple acts of love. I believe this journey will not only strengthen my relationship with God but also guide me to discover my calling.

Q6. why should you be selected for this project?

I believe I should be selected for this project because I have a genuine care for others and a strong desire to help those who are struggling. It brings me immense joy to see others find happiness and hope, and I truly believe that small acts of kindness can make a significant difference in someone's life.

I also believe that I bring a foundation of leadership experience that I hope to share with the team. For the past three years, I served as the lead for my robotics team, where I learned the importance of collaboration and communication while working towards common goals. We were fortunate to win several awards, but more importantly, I witnessed how our teamwork created personal growth and connection among team members.

I also founded a non-profit organization aimed at providing STEM education to underprivileged communities, an endeavor that has deepened my understanding of the challenges faced by others and reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact. My experiences teaching snowboarding and mentoring younger students in STEM have further developed my ability to guide and support others effectively.

While I have these experiences, I am always looking to grow and learn from others. I believe that being part of this project will allow me to do just that—while also contributing to the collective mission of spreading love and hope. I am excited about the possibility of working alongside others who share this passion, and I hope to be an encouraging presence in our shared journey.

Q7. If we were to interview your friends and classmates how do you think they would describe the integrity and depth of your relationship with Jesus? 

If you were to interview my friends and classmates, I believe they would describe my relationship with Jesus as genuine and evolving. Throughout my time at PCA, I have been on a journey of exploring my faith and deepening my understanding of God. While I may not have always expressed my faith as openly as I would like, I believe this exploration has allowed me to build a more authentic and meaningful relationship with Him. My friends would likely recognize my sincerity and the care I have for others, reflecting the love of Christ in my actions. For example, whenever a friend is facing a difficult time, whether it's academic pressure or personal struggles, I make it a point to be there for them, offering a listening ear or helping them find solutions. I strive to support and uplift those around me, even when I’m still working through my own challenges in faith. I see this as an opportunity for growth, as I learn to be more vocal about my beliefs and share my experiences with others. 

Q8. What effort have you made to be involved in sharing the gospel, serving the poor and blessing others sacrificially in the past year

Over the past year, I’ve really tried to be more active in sharing the gospel and serving others. One of the most impactful experiences has been going on service trips to downtown Toronto, where we not only fed the homeless but also had the chance to share the gospel with them. It was both humbling and inspiring to see how open people were to talking about faith, even in such challenging circumstances. Beyond that, I’ve been working to guide a close friend and some family members to know Jesus, understanding how vital it is to be there for people when they are struggling spiritually. While I have also been reflecting on my own faith journey, I’ve recognized that even as I grow in my relationship with Christ, I have the responsibility to actively share His love and teachings with others. In every opportunity I’ve had, whether it's through my non-profit STEM work or simply helping friends in need, I’ve aimed to bless others with a sense of love and support that reflects my relationship with Jesus. It's not always easy, and I'm still learning, but every effort I make to serve feels like a step closer to the purpose God has for me.
Q9. How do you handle conflict and disagreements within the context of a team? Give an example of how you've worked through a conflict before.

Handling conflict within a team is always a delicate process, but I believe it's essential to approach disagreements with empathy and open communication. As the team captain of our VEX robotics team, I encountered a significant conflict when two team members had strong, opposing views about the robot design. Their argument escalated to the point where it became personal, which threatened our team cohesion if left unresolved.

To address the situation, I decided to take a step back and talk to each person individually. This allowed me to understand their perspectives and the reasons behind their passion for their ideas. I wanted to ensure that each team member felt heard and valued, as I believe that recognizing individual contributions is crucial for resolving conflicts.

After our one-on-one discussions, I brought them both together in a room to facilitate a meaningful conversation. I shared the insights I had gathered from each of them, highlighting their strengths and the validity of their ideas. This approach not only creates understanding but also encourages them to see each other's viewpoints.

Ultimately, this collaborative discussion led to a design that incorporated elements from both perspectives, resulting in one of our best robots that year. By handling the conflict this way, I learned that open dialogue and a focus on shared goals can turn disagreements into opportunities for growth. These disputes for me are never negative because it helps stronger relationships within the team.

Q10. how would you explain the purpose of this mission trip to a friend who doesn’t understand why you're going? 

I would explain the purpose of this mission trip to my friend by emphasizing that it's an opportunity to grow both spiritually and personally while making a meaningful impact on others. I’d tell them that the trip isn't just about helping people; it’s also about building connections and sharing experiences that can transform lives, including our own.

I’d share that I’m excited to deepen my relationship with God and learn more about my purpose in this world. By serving those in need and sharing the gospel, we can bring hope and joy to others who might be struggling. It’s about creating a community of support and love, where we can learn from each other and grow together in faith.

I would emphasize that this mission trip is a chance to step outside my comfort zones and be the hands and feet of Jesus in a practical way. It's a chance to be inspired and to inspire others while contributing to a greater cause. I believe that these experiences can help shape who we are and guide us in how we serve others in our daily lives.

Q11. If this team were not traveling to Spain but instead going to downtown Toronto, would you still be as interested in participating? Why or why not?

Absolutely, I would still be very interested in participating if the team were going to downtown Toronto. The heart of the mission remains the same: to serve others, share the gospel, and grow in our faith. Serving in Toronto would offer a unique opportunity to connect with our local community and address the needs of those around us, which I believe is equally important.

Having previously volunteered in downtown Toronto, I’ve seen firsthand the challenges faced by many individuals there, particularly those experiencing homelessness. I feel a strong calling to support those in need, regardless of location. Engaging with the community in my own city would allow me to make a tangible impact and share the love of Jesus in a familiar environment.

Being involved in local service initiatives would help strengthen our bonds as a team while allowing us to apply what we learn in a different context. Whether in Spain or Toronto, I’m excited about the opportunity to grow spiritually and help others. 

Also since this mission trip is a unique opportunity offered by PCA, it would be a shame to miss out on this experience during my last year here. I want to make the most of my time at PCA and contribute to the community in a meaningful way, whether that’s in Toronto or abroad. The chance to connect with others, share the gospel, and grow in my faith is something I truly cherish, regardless of the location. Participating in this mission trip would allow me to be a part of something special, creating connections and creating memories that will last a lifetime.

Q12. Have you been on a mission trip before? 

While I have participated in a mission trip to China in the past, it was so long ago that I can’t truly reflect on its impact on me or the contributions I made during that experience. Because of this, I feel like it doesn’t quite count in the same way. I am genuinely hoping that this upcoming mission trip will be a meaningful and impactful experience that I can fully embrace and remember for years to come.

Over the past two years, I haven’t been able to join the mission trips due to scheduling conflicts with my robotics competitions. However, this year, I’ve stepped away from the competition scene to focus on my applications, which has opened up the opportunity for me to participate in this mission trip.

I believe that being part of this team would allow me to grow in my faith and make a positive impact on others. I’m excited about the chance to share the love of Jesus and connect with people in need, fostering meaningful relationships along the way. This mission trip represents a unique opportunity for personal growth and spiritual enrichment, and I would be honored to be a part of it.
