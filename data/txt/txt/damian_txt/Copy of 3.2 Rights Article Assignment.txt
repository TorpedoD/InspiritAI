Is this right also seen in the Canadian Charter of Human rights? Where can it be found? If not, should it be added, why or why not? (2 mark)
https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/how-rights-protected/guide-canadian-charter-rights-freedoms.html
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, a part of the Canadian Constitution, does not specifically mention the right to life as a protected right. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted Section 7 of the Charter, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and security of the person, to include the right to life. Therefore, the right to life is protected by the Canadian Charter through the interpretation of the courts in the context of Section 7. There are arguments on both sides of whether the right to life should be explicitly added to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Some argue that it is important to have the right to life explicitly protected in the Charter to ensure that it is given the proper weight and consideration by courts and government officials. While others argue that the right to life is already protected under Section 7 and that adding it as a separate right could be used to restrict access to abortion or end of life care.

Does this right follow the common good in a democratic society? Why or why not? (2 marks)

The interpretation of the right to life in a democratic society can vary depending on the values and beliefs of the society in question. In a democracy, the government is accountable to the people, and the laws and policies of a country should reflect the will of the majority while protecting the rights of minorities and the marginalized. In a democratic society, the right to life is often seen as a fundamental right that should be protected by the state. This right can be in line with the common good as it is necessary for the preservation of human life and dignity. It is also a right that is essential for the protection of other human rights, such as the right to liberty and security of the person. The protection of the right to life is seen as an important aspect of the common good in any society.

John Calhoun was a politician and statesman from South Carolina who served as the seventh Vice President of the United States from 1825 to 1832. He was a strong advocate for the "positive good" theory of slavery, which argued that slavery was not only a necessary evil, but also a positive good for both the enslaved and the enslavers. He played a key role in the passage of laws that helped to preserve and expand the institution of slavery in the United States, and helped to create the doctrine of "nullification," which held that states had the right to nullify federal laws they deemed unconstitutional. It's important to note that Calhoun's actions and beliefs were deeply harmful to millions of enslaved individuals and their descendants, and slavery is a morally reprehensible and inhumane practice.
