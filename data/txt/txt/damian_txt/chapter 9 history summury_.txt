The stock market crash of 1929
The Great Depression had various causes, including the 1929 stock market crash, which resulted in massive selling of stocks by investors. Initially, financial experts had reassured the public that the market was fundamentally sound. However, by October, the selling pressure had intensified, leading to significant declines in stock prices.

Saskatchewan in the 1930s
Wheat was a key crop for Prairie farmers in the 1920s and 30s, but falling prices and tariffs on imports led to crop devastation. By 1928, wheat prices had dropped to a low of 80 cents a bushel, while factors such as drought, dust storms, high temperatures, and grasshopper swarms further contributed to difficulties faced by Prairie farmers.
