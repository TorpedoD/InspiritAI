	Low-pressure, deoxygenated blood enters the heart through the superior and inferior vena cava veins. The superior vein brings blood from the head and arms, while the inferior veins come from the torso and legs. The deoxygenated blood then enters the right atrium, passing through the right AV valve to enter the right ventricle. For the deoxygenated blood to get pumped to the lungs, it first passes through the right semilunar valve and out of the left and right pulmonary arteries. Once the blood passes through the lungs, re-entering the heart, oxygenated blood flows through the left and right pulmonary veins. Then it flows into the left atrium, is pumped through the left AV valve, and then goes into the left ventricle. To be able to be pumped to the rest of the body it has to first go through the left semilunar valve and out the aortas
