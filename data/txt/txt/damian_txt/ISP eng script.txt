Elie Wiesel, in his memoir "Night," recounts his harrowing experiences during the Holocaust, focusing on themes of dehumanization, loss of faith, and the struggle for survival in the face of unimaginable cruelty. Through vivid narrative, personal reflection, and the use of rhetorical devices such as symbolism, irony, and imagery, Wiesel conveys the profound impact of the Holocaust on his faith, identity, and understanding of humanity. He achieves this by detailing his journey from a devout Jewish teenager to a disillusioned survivor who questions the existence of God and the nature of human cruelty, particularly highlighting the moments of intense suffering, ethical dilemmas, and moments of solidarity or betrayal among the prisoners. Wiesel's memoir serves not only as a testament to the atrocities he and millions of others endured but also as a call to remember and learn from the past, aimed at a broad audience to foster empathy, awareness, and a commitment to preventing such horrors in the future. Through "Night," Wiesel not only documents his personal loss of innocence and faith but also challenges readers to confront the depths of human evil and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of such darkness

Through vivid description, personal reflection, and the use of rhetorical devices such as symbolism, irony, and imagery, 
He achieves this by describing his faith journey during the Holocaust, focusing on moments of suffering, dilemmas, and moments of reflection. One of the moments even detailed that in times of anguish, he found himself praying to a God whose existence he no longer believe in.
"Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, that turned my life into one long night seven times sealed…Never shall I forget those flames that consumed my faith forever. Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes. Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God himself. Never."
Witnessing the hanging of a young boy, where Wiesel heard others questioning "Where is God?" and he responded in his mind "Here He is - He is hanging here on this gallows". This was a turning point where Wiesel's faith began to falter.
He also described how his identity and morals were transformed through the struggle to survive the concentration camps, mostly highlighted through his relationship with his father. As he faced the dilemma of prioritizing his own survival over loyalty to his parents, the book conveys his internal conflict and the shattering of his previously held beliefs and values through the abandonment of his father.
"One day when I was able to get up, I decided to look at myself in the mirror on the opposite wall. I had not seen myself since the ghetto. From the depths of the mirror, a corpse was contemplating me. The look in his eyes as he gazed at me has never left me."

I think Elie Wiesel's memoir "Night" is a powerful and effective work of storytelling. Through his first-hand narration, he draws the reader into his personal experience of the Holocaust, describing the crushing feeling of the loss of identity and faith through the struggle for survival. The use of literary devices like imagery and symbolism makes the reader confront the weight of his spiritual and moral anguish. The tone creates a sense of connection, as he describes his journey through the Holocaust and the changes along the way.  

A key takeaway I had from "Night" is the fragility of faith and the resilience of the human spirit. As he witnesses the horrors of the Holocaust, Wiesel's religious beliefs are shattered, leading him to question how God could allow such cruelty. Yet, even as his faith falters, the book demonstrates Wiesel's incredible will to survive, driven by his devotion to his father. Despite the overwhelming trauma, he finds the resolve to endure the concentration camps, showing remarkable strength and perseverance of the human spirit. The book also highlights others who maintained their faith and resolve to survive the Holocaust, showing how their resilience allowed them to live through the atrocities and even save lives, including Wiesel. 

I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars, as it describes incredible resilience and the will to live for others. Wiesel shows that even in the most desperate times, people will always find a way to live. The book becomes more impactful as it is written by a survivor of the Holocaust, showing a first hand experience at the external and internal struggles of the people at the concentration camp. His vivid descriptions and use of literary devices create an impactful reading experience that stays with the reader even after finishing the book.
