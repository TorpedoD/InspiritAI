First Last Homeroom 
How long have you known the referee for and in what capacity? 
I have known Miss Cho for 2 years. I have taken your classes in World religion, and Chemistry. I have enjoyed the talks we had after class discussing the topics in class for a more in depth understanding. 
Personal experience: I appreciated the classes that you have taught as it has been one of the first classes in high school where I have been challenged to think and apply my learning. It is a class where although I didn’t do as well, it left a deep understanding of the topic. This is why I am humbly requesting assistance in writing this reference letter as I understand how truthful you can be when writing about my character. Especially when you have pointed out my flaws during the time that you have taught me, your advice has really helped me improve myself. I am extremely grateful for your guidance and the time you took to write this reference letter. 
Note: 
I am incredibly grateful for the time and effort you’re dedicating to writing my letter of recommendation. As this letter is for a US application, I wanted to briefly touch on some of the differences in values compared to Canadian universities' reference letters. In the US, a recommendation letter plays a crucial role in verifying the authenticity of an application, and it holds significant weight in the admissions process.
With that in mind, I would greatly appreciate it if you could write your true personal opinion about my character and contributions in class. It would be especially helpful if you could highlight specific experiences or moments that made me stand out as a student, as well as your thoughts (if any) on my future potential. If applicable, please feel free to mention any areas where I can improve, presented in a constructive light.
There’s no need to explicitly focus on listing my extracurricular activities, as the letter should primarily reflect my personality, character, and academic growth. However, feel free to reference these activities as supporting evidence where relevant.
Thank you once again for your support in this process, and for taking the time to write this recommendation letter.
I hope this doesn’t come across as impolite, but I understand that writing a letter about someone requires a genuine understanding of their character. If at any point you feel that you're unable to continue due to a lack of familiarity with my background, I completely understand and would have no issue if you chose not to proceed. I would prefer that the letter not be written if it might make you feel uncomfortable or insincere in portraying my character.

Please neatly write a brief summary of some highlights that may give your referee  more insight into how you are qualified for this award/scholarship and/or about  your post-secondary goals. 
My post-secondary goals are to pursue a career in either cybersecurity or AI development. I am particularly interested in designing a personal AI assistant similar to Jarvis from Iron Man, optimizing AI models through advancements in CPU architecture, or developing AI systems that enhance network security by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities. To achieve these goals, I plan to study computer engineering, which will provide me with a comprehensive understanding of both hardware and software, enabling me to contribute meaningfully to these fields

This is my activity list that I have provided to the common app

This is my common app essay if you wish to read it. It talks about finding my sense of self and identity. 

Here are some more questions that may give you more clarification on my character. 
What personal qualities do you value in yourself?
I deeply value my intrinsic motivation to learn and grow, driven by a genuine curiosity for self-improvement. This dedication is most evident in my passion for robotics, where I’ve often devoted over 40 hours a week to working on projects purely out of curiosity and a desire to enhance my skills. I also cherish my perspective on life, viewing the world as an endless source of experiences—both good and bad. This outlook has led me to appreciate every moment and has strengthened my faith in God.

What do you consider to be your greatest strengths? Weaknesses?
I believe my greatest strength lies in my ability to adapt and thrive in any situation or challenge. Moving between different countries and cultures taught me how to embrace change and continuously grow. Adaptation has become a core strength of mine, allowing me to keep an open mind, view challenges positively, and always seek solutions rather than dwell on setbacks.

In terms of my greatest weakness, I’ve come to realize that I have at times lowered my expectations for myself. I’ve allowed moments of complacency to prevent me from pushing that extra mile toward excellence. This is something I recognize, especially in how I’ve approached tasks like homework, where I haven’t always held myself accountable to the high standards I once had. I understand now that, to achieve my dreams, I need to re-establish the mindset that expects nothing less than my best—whether it’s aiming for a 95% instead of settling for a 90%. I know that setting higher standards for myself will enable me to fully reach my potential, and continue the level of expectation I had for myself in the past.

Why did you decide to apply to colleges in the United States? Why do you think this is a good choice for you?
I am eager to study in the US because of my passion for travel and my desire to continue experiencing diverse cultures and educational systems. Having received my education in various countries, I’ve been exposed to different work ethics and approaches to learning. Now, I’m excited to immerse myself in the dynamic environment of the US. What particularly draws me to the US is the country's renowned drive, motivation, and persistence in pursuing innovation. As a global leader in technological advancements, the US has long been at the forefront of progress, and I’m inspired by the excellence and continuous self-improvement that characterize its people and institutions. This strong culture of striving for success is something I deeply resonate with, and it is why I am excited to pursue my education there.

How do you want other people to perceive you in your life?
I hope to be perceived by others as someone who is kind, dedicated, and committed to serving others. My vision of success is not just about personal achievements, but about contributing to the advancement of society as a whole. I wish to help others and provide meaningful opportunities, just as others have generously done for me throughout my life. In doing so, I aim to create a positive impact and foster growth within my community.
