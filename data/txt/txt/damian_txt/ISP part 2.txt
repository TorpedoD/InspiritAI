His purpose of the book

Section 1 (4 - 5)
In 1941, Eliezer, a twelve-year-old boy, lives in Sighet, Transylvania, in an orthodox Jewish family.
His family strictly adheres to Jewish tradition, with his father being a respected shopkeeper in the Jewish community.
Eliezer studies Jewish texts, including the Talmud and Kabbalah, against his father's wishes, guided by Moishe the Beadle, a pauper with profound teachings.
Moishe is taken by the Germans, but escapes. He warns of impending danger as foreign Jews, including himself, are expelled by the Hungarians but is dismissed as delusional by the townsfolk.
In 1944, the Hungarian government falls to Germany, and German forces occupy Hungary, leading to escalating anti-Semitic measures.
Jews are subjected to increasing oppression, including arrests of community leaders, confiscation of valuables, and being forced to wear yellow stars.
The Jews of Sighet are confined to ghettos and eventually face deportation to concentration camps.
Eliezer's family, among the last to be deported, tragically declines a gentile's offer of refuge, and they are herded onto cattle cars bound for Auschwitz.
Their journey exemplifies the horrors endured by Jews during the Holocaust

Section 2 (6 - 7) 
Jews are packed into cattle cars under unbearable conditions, with little air, intense heat, no seating, and hunger and thirst.
Some passengers lose their sense of decorum, openly flirting or pretending not to notice.
At the Czechoslovakian border, a German officer threatens violence and nails the car doors shut.
Madame Schächter, a woman with her son, panics and screams about a fire outside the car, terrifying others.
Initially dismissed as crazy, she is eventually tied up and gagged, but her screams persist.
Upon reaching Auschwitz, prisoners are told they will be treated well, but Madame Schächter's screams continue.
Passing by vast furnaces emitting a terrible odour, the prisoners realize they are at Birkenau, the processing centre for Auschwitz.

Section 3 (7 - 8)
At Birkenau, a selection process begins where those deemed weak or less useful are chosen for immediate death. Eliezer and his father are separated from his mother and sister, never to see them again.
Advised by a fellow prisoner, they lie about their ages to Dr. Mengele, who determines their fate. They are directed to join the labour force.
Witnessing atrocities at Birkenau, including the burning of babies and adults in pits, Eliezer questions humanity's existence, while his father finds solace in prayer.
Their group is spared from immediate death and sent to barracks for processing. They undergo dehumanizing procedures, including shaving, disinfection, and uniform issuance.
Eliezer's father is beaten by a Kapo, and Eliezer grapples with his own inability to protect him.
Transferred to Auschwitz, they receive identification tattoos and encounter a relative, Stein, who later discovers the truth about his family's fate, severing ties with Eliezer.
Despite the horrors, some prisoners maintain faith in God and hope for redemption, as they are moved to the Buna work camp for internment.

Section 4 (9 - 10)
Eliezer and his father serve in a unit tasked with counting electrical fittings in a warehouse at Buna concentration camp. They share a block with a kind German Jew, where Eliezer befriends Juliek, a Jewish violinist, and Zionist brothers Yosi and Tibi.
Despite the hardships, some prisoners maintain hope for deliverance, such as Akiba Drumer, whose faith remains strong.
Idek, the Kapo overseeing their work, is prone to violent outbursts. He beat Eliezer mercilessly one day, prompting a small act of kindness from a French girl working nearby.
Eliezer's father falls victim to Idek's rage, and Eliezer struggles with his own survival instincts overriding his concern for his father's well-being.
Franek, the foreman, demands Eliezer's gold crown, resorting to cruelty when Eliezer refuses. Eventually, Eliezer gives it up to stop the abuse.
During an Allied air raid, chaos ensues as prisoners risk their lives for soup, resulting in tragic deaths and public hangings by the Nazis.
Witnessing such brutality, Eliezer questions the presence of God in a world filled with such cruelty, feeling that God has been "murdered" alongside the innocent victims.


Section 5 (11 - 12)
As the Jewish High Holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur arrive in the summer of 1944, the Jews at Buna concentration camp gather to observe despite their suffering. Eliezer's rebellion against God intensifies as he struggles to find meaning in their plight, feeling abandoned and alone.
During Yom Kippur, Eliezer decides to break the fast, further distancing himself from his faith. Despite his inner turmoil, he finds a moment of connection with his despairing father.
Following the holidays, another selection occurs, and Eliezer's father is deemed too weak to work and faces execution. Miraculously, his father survives the selection, but others, like Akiba Drumer, lose hope and perish.
With the onset of winter, the prisoners endure harsh conditions, exacerbated by Eliezer's swollen foot requiring surgery. Rumors of the approaching Russian army offer hope, but the Germans evacuate the camp before their arrival.
Believing they will face death if they remain in the infirmary, Eliezer and his father choose to evacuate with the others, only to realize later they made the wrong decision. Bleeding and battered, they join the grueling evacuation through a snowstorm, unsure of what lies ahead.

Section 6 (13)
Amidst a blizzard and darkness, the prisoners of Buna endure a forced evacuation, compelled to keep running under threat of being shot by the SS. Zalman, unable to continue, is tragically trampled to death.
Eliezer, weakened by his injured foot, pushes himself to run alongside his father, solely driven by their mutual survival. They cover over forty-two miles through the night, finally reaching a deserted village.
Father and son cling to each other for support and stay awake to fend off the deadly cold. Rabbi Eliahou, seeking his son, enters their shelter. Despite witnessing the son's abandonment of his father during the run, Eliezer lies to the rabbi, praying he will never betray his own father's trust in such a manner.

Section 7 (14)
Upon arriving at Gleiwitz camp, exhausted prisoners scramble to enter the barracks, with Eliezer and his father being thrown to the ground in the chaotic rush. Eliezer finds himself lying on top of Juliek, a friend from Buna, and narrowly avoids being crushed.
Juliek's haunting violin music fills the air amidst the dying men, providing a brief moment of solace before his death. When Eliezer wakes, he discovers Juliek dead, his violin destroyed.
During a selection process, Eliezer's father is chosen to die, but Eliezer manages to sneak him back to safety. They are then herded into roofless cattle cars for a grueling ten-day journey without food, surviving on snow.
Passing through German towns, locals throw bread into the cars, inciting violence among the starving prisoners. Eliezer recalls a similar scene in Aden after the Holocaust, where a wealthy tourist's charity leads to violence among impoverished boys.
Amidst the chaos, Eliezer witnesses horrifying acts of violence, including a son beating his own father to death over a piece of bread. Meir Katz, a friend who rescues Eliezer from an attempted strangulation, eventually succumbs to despair and dies before their arrival at Buchenwald.

Section 8 (15)
The journey to Buchenwald has left Eliezer's father fatally weakened, and upon arrival, he sits in the snow, refusing to move, seemingly resigned to death. Despite Eliezer's attempts to convince him otherwise, his father asks only to rest.
During an air raid alert, Eliezer leaves his father in the snow and falls asleep in the barracks. Upon waking, he reluctantly searches for his father, torn between thoughts of abandoning him and conserving his own strength.
Despite his internal struggle, Eliezer finds his father, who is very sick and immobile. Eliezer brings him soup and coffee but feels guilty for wanting to keep the food for himself.
Eliezer's father deteriorates further, afflicted with dysentery and thirst. Eliezer tries in vain to get medical help for him, but the doctors refuse to treat him, and other prisoners steal his food and beat him.
Despite the head of the block advising Eliezer to prioritize his own survival, Eliezer continues to care for his father. However, when the SS officer beats his father for crying out for water, Eliezer feels a sense of relief.
On January 29, 1945, Eliezer wakes to discover his father has been taken to the crematory. Instead of crying, he feels shame and relief, signalling the culmination of his struggle to reconcile his own survival with his father's suffering.

Section 9 (16) 
In Buchenwald, Eliezer becomes consumed with thoughts of food, disconnected from thoughts of liberation or his family. As the American army approaches on April 5, the Nazis plan to exterminate the remaining Jews in the camp, resulting in daily mass murders.
On April 10, as the evacuation and killing of the remaining 20,000 prisoners is set to begin, an air-raid siren disrupts the plan, sending everyone indoors. Seemingly returning to normalcy, the resistance movement launches an attack, driving the SS out of the camp.
On April 11, the American army liberates Buchenwald, but the prisoners are solely focused on satisfying their hunger. Eliezer succumbs to food poisoning and spends weeks gravely ill in the hospital.
Upon finally seeing himself in a mirror for the first time since leaving Sighet, Eliezer is shocked by his emaciated appearance, describing the reflection as that of a corpse gazing back at him.
