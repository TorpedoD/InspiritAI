"What is Canadian identity?"

I believe that Canadian identity is the shared characteristics we all have, such as values, beliefs, customs, and experiences that define a sense of belonging to Canada. This identity is shaped by different factors such as geography, history, culture, language, ets. It defines us for who we are, a community where diverse perspectives, experiences, and cultures are widely accepted.
