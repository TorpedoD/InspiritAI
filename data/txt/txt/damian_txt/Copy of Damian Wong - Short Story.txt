	We all know the events of 9/11, the tragic event that changed the world forever. One of the major global terrorist attack that caused scars to be carved in everyones hearts on that day the day that the twin towers fell. The global panic that occurred when the first plane hit the side of the national trade centre. Well that is what should have happened. You see, I remembered the event quite differently from everyone else that day, maybe I was halucinating or mentally unstable; however, that may have been what truly happened that day. 
	I remember everything as clear as day



	
We all remember the events that occurred on September 11th, the day that left a mark on this world as deep as the first and second world wars. Panic spread like wildfire when a few Muslims, yelling a few questionable worlds, decided to fly a plane into the Twin Tower. It is a horrifying act of terrorism that etched a scar that will be remembered forever, even in the current generations. I’m sure everyone has at least felt the horrors of TSA at least once right. As the two towers burned and fell to the ground, the American hearts fell with it, creating one of the largest tragedies in American history. Well… that's what should have happened. You see, for some reason, I remember the event quite differently from everyone else that day. Maybe I was hallucinating or mentally unstable; perhaps I had eaten one too many vitamin gummies the same morning. But as everyone says: “trust what you see,” so as far as I'm concerned, I believe what I saw that day. You might think I am some crazy conspiracy theorist, and sure, believe what you want, but I’m merely here today to tell you my version of this story. 

	The story starts off as we all know it, with a beautiful september morning: the clear blue sky, the air crisp and cool, and the faint smel of the Hudson River. It was just the best kind of day in the summer—the kind where you wake up and are actually ready to start a day of work. There I was, sitting in Starbucks, contemplating life, as the sweet aromas of coffee drifted around the shop. I glanced at the two structures in front of me, imagining where I could have been if I had just passed high school and been accepted to a good university. I mean, it was my dream job back then, and it “was” for many before the inevitable happened. Everything was going according to the original story until 8:46 AM roled around when the first plane was supposed to hit the North Tower. Now, here’s where things start change, the plane never actually intended to hit the tower. Yes, there was a plane that was on course to hit the tower, but as far as I remember the plane just missed the tower. I’m not sure weather the pilot was drunk, or some one decided to bail the suicide flight, but all I know was that the first plane just missed the tower. I’m not saying the plane never hit the tower, im just saying that the plane did intend to hit the tower. 

In the strangest turn of events, the plane seemed to stop in mid-air, hanging like a puppet on invisible strings. It was as if the plane had encountered some sort of invisible barrier. For a few surreal moments, it appeared to be glitching, like a character in a video game stuck between frames. People around me started gasping, pointing upwards, and some were frantically calling loved ones. The plane flickered in and out of existence, emitting an eerie, digital distortion sound. Then, in a blink, the plane teleported right in front of the North Tower and crashed into it with a deafening roar. The impact was immediate. Flames and debris exploded from the tower, and a wave of panic swept through the city. Sirens blared, and people started to run, their faces masks of terror. I stood frozen, unable to process what I had just witnessed. Was it real? Had I imagined it? But the horror wasn’t over yet. As the chaos unfolded, I kept my eyes fixed on the burning tower, only to see another bizarre glitch. The same plane—or perhaps a mirrored version of it—appeared to glitch again. It flickered with that same unsettling distortion, hanging momentarily in the air as if the universe itself was buffering. This time, it reappeared right in front of the South Tower and crashed into it with even more force, creating another massive explosion. People were screaming, cars were honking, and I could barely hear my own thoughts over the cacophony. I looked around, hoping to find someone else who saw what I saw, but everyone was consumed by the sheer shock of the unfolding disaster. The towers were now both burning, their once proud silhouettes marred by smoke and flames.

So there you have it. This is my version of the story before I get silenced by the government. While everyone else remembers the tragic and horrifying events of that day as a straightforward act of terrorism, I remember it as a bizarre and unsettling sequence of virtual reality glitches. Was it a government cover-up? A simulation gone wrong? Or just my mind playing tricks on me? I’ll leave that for you to decide. But I’ll never forget the sight of that plane flickering in and out of reality, as if it were never meant to hit the towers but was somehow forced to by some unseen glitch in the fabric of our world.
