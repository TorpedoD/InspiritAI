"You are the greatest archeologist in the world, and you have been looking for the city of gold for decades. After all these years, you have found the city. When you open the ancient gates, you see the glitters running towards you. The "gold" of the city has always been thousands of golden retrievers."










































YOU ARE IN A TYPICAL AWKWARD ELEVATOR RIDE WITH A GROUP OF OTHER PEOPLE, SUDDENLY A MAN SAYS "SO, I BET YOU ARE WONDERING WHY I'VE GATHERED YOU HERE" BEFORE HITTING THE EMERGENCY STOP BUTTON.













































I am either going out for ice cream or to commit a heinous crime, i’ll decide in the car

Stuck on a seemingly mile long mcdonald drive through on a hot day during rush hour is definitely not a good way to spend your free time on a wednesday. Even with the AC on full blast, my sweat has soaked my entire shirt and is slowly destroying my expensive leather chair. But what other choice did I have, this was my third Mcdonald's drive through i've been through, and all of them had broken their ice-cream machine. I swear I'm starting to believe that they don’t have any ice-cream at all and it is all just marketing. Slowly etching up to the ordering station, as i hear for the third time “hi, welcome to Mcdonald, how can we help you today”. Finally I get to have my ice-cream

































YOU ARE STARTING TO GET REALLY SICK OF YOUR CAT ALWAYS GETTING IN YOUR WAY AND KNOCKING STUFF OUT OF YOUR HAND. LITTLE DO YOU KNOW YOUR SPOUSE IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO KILL YOU WITH TRAPS AND POISON AND THE CAT IS SAVING YOUR LIFE.

Many people believe that pets are a blessing to our soul; stories and happy owners have proven that pets have been the light of their day, every day. However, owning this fur-ball has been my greatest mistake. It is a living disaster in my house and towards my sanity, I was even demoted because of my lack of sleep. 





























YOU WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND CHECK YOUR PHONE. YOU HAVE ONE TEXT SAYING "IT'S NOT REAL. NONE OF IT. TRUST NO ONE. ESCAPE.". YOU DISMISS IT AND LEAVE YOUR ROOM TO FIND YOUR FAMILY LINED UP FACING YOU, EACH WITH A SLIGHT FROWN. "YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING STRANGE THIS MORNING, DID YOU?" ASKS YOUR MOM


“Beeb beeb, beeb beeb”. That was the last thing I wanted to hear on a saturday morning, frustrated at the fact that I forgot to turn off my alarm from yesterday on my phone. I didn’t have a particularly pleasant dream ither. It is one of those dreams that feels too real that you think it is reality, like weirdly real. I was at a lake in the middle of the night and my reflection kept telling me to wake up, and that I should not trust what I see. I hate those kinds of dreams, they always give me headaches. When I was a child I would always think that this is a prophice, and I had magic powers cause no one else would have them. What childish beliefs I had back then. “Ping”, my phone suddenly had a message. That was strange, no one wakes up on the weekends that early, everyone sleeps in till 4 pm. 
 



























You find a stack of "Missing Persons" news clippings under your parents bed. All with your photo.

Lying on my bed is always the best after a long day of school. As usual nothing much happens during the years of school, still the same boring routine: wake up, go to school, and sleep. But it doesn't seem like working would be much different, I guess that is how society works, trapped in a loop that common people can’t break out of if they want to just stay floating and not drown under the pressures of inflation and society. Life is just not like the comics and movies that we fantasize about, life is a boring cycle where nothing much happens. Until life slaps you in the face with things you can’t handle, then you'd wish that life continued to be that boring cycle. My thought process was suddenly interrupted by a big crash. Sighing got up from my comfortable position and 
































YOU'RE AN ASTRONAUT, AND AFTER A BOTCHED MISSION, FIND YOURSELF FLOATING THROUGH THE GALAXY ALONE. WITH ONLY A FEW HOURS OF OXYGEN LEFT, HOPE IS DWINDLING. JUST WHEN IT'S LOOKING GRIM, AN ALIEN SHIP PASSING BY PICKS YOU UP AND TAKES YOU ON BOARD. TO YOUR SURPRISE, THEY TAKE YOU TO A ROOM FULL OF EARTH'S SPACE JUNK, AND DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT EACH BIT OF TRASH IS.

Drifting through emptiness with nothing but my own thoughts. I tried to slow down my breathing and movement to extend the time before my inevitable fate. Hoping that I can look at the beauty around me for as long as I can
