Halifax Explosion, - December 6, 1917

	Halifax was bustling with energy on this bright December day. Its streets were abuzz with the hurried footsteps of people rushing off to work, eager to tackle the day ahead. Despite the looming weekend, the town was brimming with life and activity. The air around the harbour crackled with a sense of urgency and importance. The bustling crowds worked to open the string of nets that served as a crucial defence against enemy submarines and ships. Everyone was on edge, knowing that an important ship was due to arrive as well as one that was departing. Among the departing crew was the skilled navigator William Hayes. His expertise brought relief to the worried crew, giving them hope that the ship would pass through the treacherous Narrows safely. With the Narrows being one of Halifax's tightest channels, not a lot of ships have reached their destinations unscathed. 
	While guiding Imo through the channel past two inbound ships, Hayes suddenly realized that they had placed his ship in an unusual position. They were too far east on the inbound side of the narrow, and Hayes knew that they needed to correct their course. But as he tried to correct the ship, something unexpected happened. Out of nowhere, a massive ship appeared on the horizon, heading straight towards them. It was the Mont-Blanc, and it was barreling towards them in what Francis Mackey, the ship's pilot, believed was their lane. As the two ships closed in on each other, the tension in the air was almost palpable. Everyone on board the Imo was holding their breath, waiting to see what would happen next. And then, with a deafening roar, the ships collided.
The impact shook the harbour; the sound of metal scraping against metal was ear-splitting, and the air was filled with the smell of burning fuel. Plumes of black smoke rose into the sky like a dark signal flare, followed by a blinding flash of light that illuminated the entire town. In a matter of seconds, the air was filled with the acrid smell of burning wood and metal, and the sky was stained with the orange and red glow of a raging fire. Mini lifeboats bobbed frantically in the water, inching their way towards the shore as people shouted and screamed, trying to make themselves heard over the deafening noise. But the worst was yet to come. As the city came to a standstill, people failed to realise the danger that was lurking on board the Mont-Blanc. Only a handful of authorities were aware of the danger, and their efforts to evacuate the city were futile as they were drowned out by the cacophony of destruction around them. Meanwhile, Vincent Coleman, the railway dispatcher, was desperately trying to warn incoming passengers of the impending disaster, staying at his post until the very end. He frantically tapped out a message on his telegraph key, his fingers trembling with fear and urgency:
“Hold up the train. Munitions ship on fire and making for Pier 6 ... Goodbye boys.”
Then, at precisely 9:04:35 a.m, the Mont-Blanc exploded with an ear-shattering boom, unleashing a wave of destruction that shook the entire town to its core. The shockwave generated by the explosion rippled outward in all directions, radiating an unstoppable force of destruction. Structures trembled and crumbled under its relentless power, leaving behind a scene of devastation and death that defied belief. Homes, buildings, and landmarks that once stood proudly were reduced to rubble, their fragments scattered across the landscape. The once vibrant town now lay in ruins, forever scarred by the devastating power of the Mont-Blanc explosion.
