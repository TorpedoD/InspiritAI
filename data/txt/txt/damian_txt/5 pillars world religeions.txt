1. Shahada (Confession)
the Shahada is the fundamental declaration of faith in Islam, affirming the oneness of God (Tawhid) and the prophethood of Muhammad.
It serves as the central creedal statement and the gateway to Islam for new converts, symbolizing submission to God's will.
The Shahada consists of the declaration: "There is no God but God, and Muhammad is the apostle of God" (la ilaha ila allah, Muhammad rasul Allah).
It is recited in various life events, such as during the call to prayer, birth, conversion to Islam, and at the time of death, encapsulating the entirety of a Muslim's life.
The Shahada is a constant reminder of monotheism and allegiance to God's guidance through the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.

2. Salat (Prayer)
Muslims are obligated to perform ritual prayers (salat) five times a day at specific times: sunrise, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset, and one hour after sunset.
Men are encouraged to pray at the mosque, and women are allowed to pray at home, separating the two genders

Each prayer involves a structured sequence of physical postures (standing, bowing, and prostrating) combined with recitations from the Quran and supplications.
Prayer start
the adhan (call to prayer) announces the beginning of each prayer time, reminding Muslims to pause from worldly affairs and turn their attention to worship.
Muslims prepare themselves for prayer by ablution rinsing hands, feet, eyes, ears, noses, and mouth three times
Each sequence is called a Rakat
Friday prayers hold additional significance, with congregational prayers led by an Imam and followed by a sermon (khutbah) addressing relevant community issues.

3. Sawm (Fasting)
Sawm refers to the obligatory fasting during the month of Ramadan, from dawn until sunset, abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and other worldly pleasures.
Ramadan commemorates the revelation of the Quran to Prophet Muhammad and is a time for increased prayer, Quranic recitation, and acts of charity.
After Ramadan they celebrate Eid al-Fitr
4. Zakat (Almsgiving)
Zakat is the obligatory charity or almsgiving required of all financially capable Muslims, aimed at redistributing wealth and supporting the less fortunate.
It is typically calculated as 2.5% of one's net profit beyond a specified threshold (nisab) and is distributed to designated recipients, including the poor, needy, orphans, and travelers.
Zakat serves as a means of social justice, solidarity, and compassion, emphasizing the importance of caring for the welfare of the community.
Failure to fulfill the obligation of zakat is considered a serious transgression in Islam, with potential spiritual and societal consequences.
