Recommendation Letter Prep: Exercise 2
[Make a copy of this doc and share it with your Strategist!]


This exercise will guide you in preparing to choose which teachers you ask for recommendation letters.

Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each before emailing your chosen teachers and counselor:
What personal qualities do you value in yourself?
I deeply value my intrinsic motivation to learn and grow, driven by a genuine curiosity for self-improvement. This dedication is most evident in my passion for robotics, where I’ve often devoted over 40 hours a week to working on projects purely out of curiosity and a desire to enhance my skills. I also cherish my perspective on life, viewing the world as an endless source of experiences—both good and bad. This outlook has led me to appreciate every moment and has strengthened my faith in God.

How do you want other people to perceive you in your life?
I hope to be perceived by others as someone who is kind, dedicated, and committed to serving others. My vision of success is not just about personal achievements, but about contributing to the advancement of society as a whole. I wish to help others and provide meaningful opportunities, just as others have generously done for me throughout my life. In doing so, I aim to create a positive impact and foster growth within my community.


What are one or two experiences that shaped your outlook or sense of identity?


What do you consider to be your greatest strengths? Weaknesses?
I believe my greatest strength lies in my ability to adapt and thrive in any situation or challenge. Moving between different countries and cultures taught me how to embrace change and continuously grow. Adaptation has become a core strength of mine, allowing me to keep an open mind, view challenges positively, and always seek solutions rather than dwell on setbacks.

In terms of my greatest weakness, I’ve come to realize that I have at times lowered my expectations for myself. I’ve allowed moments of complacency to prevent me from pushing that extra mile toward excellence. This is something I recognize, especially in how I’ve approached tasks like homework, where I haven’t always hold myself accountable to the high standards I once had. I understand now that, to achieve my dreams, I need to re-establish the mindset that expects nothing less than my best—whether it’s aiming for a 95% instead of settling for a 90%. I know that setting higher standards for myself will enable me to fully reach my potential, and continue the level of expectation I had for myself in the past.

What are your current career ambitions, generally or specifically? 
Background information.



What's a significant challenge you've had to overcome and what did you learn from it? Or what’s something you continue to struggle with but are working on?
Developing a sense of confidence

What area or areas do you intend to study during college? Why? 


For international students only: why did you decide to apply to colleges in the United States? Why do you think this is a good choice for you?
I am eager to study in the US because of my passion for travel and my desire to continue experiencing diverse cultures and educational systems. Having received my education in various countries, I’ve been exposed to different work ethics and approaches to learning. Now, I’m excited to immerse myself in the dynamic environment of the US. What particularly draws me to the US is the country's renowned drive, motivation, and persistence in pursuing innovation. As a global leader in technological advancements, the US has long been at the forefront of progress, and I’m inspired by the excellence and continuous self-improvement that characterize its people and institutions. This strong culture of striving for success is something I deeply resonate with, and it is why I am excited to pursue my education there.




Elaborate on 1-3 of the extracurricular activities included in your résumé that are most important to you (for your counselors) and on 1-3 activities that are most relevant to your teachers’ areas of expertise (for your teachers).

For the first teacher you’ve chosen, answer the following:

What were some of the topics that you most enjoyed in this teacher’s class? Is there any connection between these topics and the areas you plan to pursue in college? 


Did you have any challenges in this teacher’s class? How did you overcome them? 


Is there anything else that you would like this teacher to emphasize or include in your letter? 



For the second teacher you’ve chosen, answer the following:

What were some of the topics that you most enjoyed in this teacher’s class? Is there any connection between these topics and the areas you plan to pursue in college? 


Did you have any challenges in this teacher’s class? How did you overcome them?

For the third (backup) teacher you’ve chosen, answer the following:

You’ll want to send your answers to these questions to your teachers and counselor once they’ve agreed to write letters for you, as your answers will be extremely valuable in providing them with a point of reference for who you are, how you think, and what matters to you. 

Work with your Strategist to make sure your answers are formatted nicely!
