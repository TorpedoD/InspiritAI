Summarizer part 3:
Liesel's associations with her guardians, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, commence an evolution as she gradually places her trust in and becomes dependent on them. She also forges an unbreakable bond with Rudy Steiner, her neighbor and classmate, who becomes her partner-in-crime and fellow adventurer. The central theme of the potency of language assumes a more pronounced role in this portion of the novel as Liesel's ardor for reading flourishes. Her insatiable thirst for books compels her to filch from various sources, including the library of the mayor's spouse, Ilsa Hermann, who subsequently evolves into a pivotal character in the narrative. Liesel's voracious reading habit also inspires her to compose her own stories, thus revealing the metamorphic potential of literature. As the war escalates, the community is ravaged by air raids, food shortages, and the Nazi regime's escalating power. The purity of Liesel's relationships is put to the test when she becomes privy to the persecution of the Jewish people, including her acquaintance Max Vandenburg, whom Hans and Rosa conceal in their basement. The peril and terror of being apprehended by the Nazi authorities loom constantly, adding a sense of foreboding to the narrative. In summation, this section of the story is chiefly concerned with the development of characters and their interpersonal relationships.

Essay part 4:
Rosa first treats Max in "The Book Thief" part 4 in a harsh and condescending manner. She resents his presence in their home and regards him as a burden and an annoyance. She doubts his fighting prowess and thinks that his presence may put her family in danger. Rosa initially had a negative opinion of Max, but as she saw his kindness and work ethic, she started to change her mind. She starts to respect him more and even assists him in building a temporary snowman.
Rosa's initial reaction to Max did not especially surprise me because her persona has been developed throughout the novel as sarcastic and impatient. Nonetheless, her final attitude adjustment demonstrates her capacity for development and sensitivity. Additionally, it emphasizes how Max's kindness and upbeat outlook benefit everyone around him, even in trying situations. Therefore, Rosa's behavior towards Max shows us that, despite being initially critical and closed-minded, she is capable of maturing and developing compassion.
