intro
The minerals used in electronic parts have caused the depletion of natural resources due to their short life expectancy. This resulted in higher demand for mined resources and increased mining malpractice, with mining increasing by 55% since 2002. This problem stems from the extraction methods used to obtain materials such as gold, copper, and rare earth elements. The increasing use of devices, driven by progress and higher consumer demand, has worsened this issue. 

Mining Contamination and Environmental Impact:
The extraction and processing of minerals in the mining industry have a major effect on the environment. This is because various chemicals like mercury, cyanide, and sulfuric acid are used, can be carried away from mining sites that damages the ecosystems. Like The Gold King Mine spill in 2015 was a significant incident near Colorado. The spill involved the accidental release of millions of gallons of acidic, metal-laden wastewater into the Animas River, causing irreversible damage to the ecosystem. Additionally, mining activities contribute to deforestation. The destruction of habitats leads to a decline in biodiversity. Communities near mining sites or located in their vicinity face health risks due to exposure to substances. 

Measures to Reduce Impact:

Improved Mining Practices:
The need to reduce ecological impact has led to the implementation of cutting-edge technologies and friendly extraction methods. Although These advancements do not signify a shift away from mining practices that harm the environment they do demonstrate a conscious endeavour to reduce the ecological impact of mining activities.

These measures include using processing methods to minimize water usage, implementing systems for managing toxic waste and prevent the release of harmful substances. Advanced exploration techniques like sensing and GIS help with exploration while minimizing land disturbance. Ecosystems can be prioritized by establishing protected areas around mining sites and utilizing strategies for biodiversity conservation. Following industry standards such as ISO 14001 and Responsible Mining Initiative would also allow for a more sustainable and ecofriendly procedures, that minimises the damage to the environment

Recycling and Circular Economy:
One significant approach to reducing the effects of mining pollution is by shifting our focus towards recycling. A crucial step in this direction is promoting the recycling of waste, which helps decrease the need for extracted materials. By reusing components from discarded electronics, we not only minimize the demand for resources but also align with sustainable practices and waste reduction. Like how Apple created a factory in the Netherlands to disassemble valuable metals from each phone in under 18 seconds, which is around 2.4 million a year. With the purity of each metal in the phone, each tone of extracted materials will correspond to 2000 tons of mined rock, skipping the purification process as well. 



Government Regulations:
Effective environmental management in the mining industry relies heavily on government regulations. These regulations serve as a foundation for ensuring practices that prioritize environmental sustainability. By strengthening these rules, governments act as guardians, holding mining corporations accountable and demanding adherence to their methods. Clear standards and consequences for noncompliance established by governments play a role in reducing pollution and minimizing harm to the environment. For example, the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA) in the United States. Enacted in 1977, SMCRA addresses the environmental impacts of coal mining and aims to ensure that surface coal mining operations are conducted in a manner that minimizes harm to the environment, 


Conclusion:
 As demand for electronic parts continues to increase, it becomes crucial to prioritize sustainable and ethical practices in the mining sector. By implementing and enforcing regulations, embracing technologies, and by preventing the mining process in the first place, we can take a comprehensive approach to minimizing the environmental impact caused by mining activities.

Cervical Pain Syndrome.

Intro
Cervical Pain Syndrome is greatly influenced by technology and prolonged computer usage. Bad posture, screen time, and improper ergonomic habits all play a role in causing discomfort and pain in the neck and shoulder area. 
In a case study A 16-year-old girl was admitted to a pediatric unit for a medical history of headache, dizziness, and acute neck pain. After many examinations, the MRI examination revealed the abnormally bent nature of the spine. The strange syndrom was then revealed when the high-school student described her daily routine of almost 6 h/day dedicated to studying, and working on the computer, which included excessive forward bending of the neck causing the abnormal bending of the spine. 

Technology's Contribution to Cervical Pain Syndrome:
The rise of technology, computers, and cellphones has led to sedentary behaviour and extended periods of screen time. Spending time using these devices often leads to poor posture, such as a forward tilt of the head and slumped shoulders. These postures strain the neck muscles, causing imbalances and the development of cervical pain syndrome. With technology being so prevalent in both work and personal life, this issue has become quite common in today's connected world.

Negative Impact on Individuals:
Cervical pain syndrome impacts a range of people, from office workers who spend periods in front of computer screens to students working on projects or scoling through entertainment. This condition results in discomfort and pain in the neck and shoulder area, which can greatly affect tasks and overall health. If left untreated, it may lead to long term pain, increased problems such as cervical spondylosis and a deterioration in the quality of life for those experiencing it.

Measures to Reduce Impact:

Ergonomic Workspace Design:
Incorporating principles into office design improves the well being of individuals. Doctors recommend haveing chairs that can be adjusted and provide lumbar support, as they offer both comfort and proper alignment to prevent strain on the spine. Additionally, ensuring that workstations are set at a certain height is crucial for maintaining a position for the wrists and arms while also reducing unnecessary discomfort in the neck and shoulders. Positioning computer monitors at eye level also helps promote neck position, thereby minimizing the risk of developing Cervical pain syndrome.. 

Regular breaks and stretching exercises:
Taking breaks during periods of screen time is really important for preventing muscle fatigue and promoting overall well being. These breaks do not give your body a chance to rest. They also help refresh your mind. by incorporate stretching exercises into these breaks that focus on the neck and shoulder areas it can improve flexibility and reduce tension in those muscles. Simple movements, like rotating your neck, rolling your shoulders, and doing stretches, can easily become a good habit. These exercises not only counter the effects of sitting for too long but also improve blood circulation, which reduces the chances of experiencing cervical pain syndrome.

Screen Time Management:
Implementing strategies, like incorporating scheduled breaks during which people can take a break from screens, can contribute to mental health. Taking detox periods and intentionally disconnecting from devices provides a much needed relief for the neck and helps alleviate the negative impacts of extended screen time. By adopting these management techniques, individuals can find an equilibrium between their work and health .

Conclusion:
while technology plays a part in our lives, it is crucial to consider its impact on our physical well being especially when it comes to conditions like cervical pain syndrome. By embracing practices, raising awareness about the issue and effectively managing screen time, both individuals and organizations can take steps to minimize the risk of this common health problem that arises from our modern, tech driven lifestyles.
