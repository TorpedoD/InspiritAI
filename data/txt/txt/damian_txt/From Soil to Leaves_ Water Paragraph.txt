	Plants need water for their survival, growth, and reproduction. Plants absorb water and minerals from the soil through their roots. The root system of a plant is responsible for anchoring the plant in the ground and absorbing water and minerals from the soil.The endodermis is a single layer of cells that surrounds the root's vascular tissue. The endodermis acts as a gatekeeper, routing the movement of water and minerals into the xylem. 
	There are two main ways for a plant to transport water root pressure and transpiration. Root pressure is the force that pushes water and minerals up the stem of a plant, It is created by having a higher concentration of minerals within the plant compared to the soil, which allows a faster rate of diffusion; thereby creating a force that pushes water up the plant. Transpiration creates a negative pressure or tension that pulls water and minerals up from the roots to the leaves. Once the water evaporates or is used by the plant during photosynthesis, this creates a gap that needs to be filled. 
	Cohesion and adhesion are two properties of water that play a crucial role in the upward movement of water in plants. Cohesion refers to the attraction of water molecules to each other, while adhesion refers to the attraction of water molecules to other surfaces. These two properties allow water to form a continuous column in the Xylem, which facilitates the movement of water up the stem of the plant.
