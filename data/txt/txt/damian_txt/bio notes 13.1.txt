Why plants are valuable 

The biosphere depends on plants 
Provides many important services to the ecosystem
Privideing food
Habitat 
Producing oxygen
Providing fibre for humans creating clothing and structures 
Reducing soil erosion 
A fuel source
Most important 
The photosynthesise 
Contain cellulose 

Photosynthesis 
Converts solar energy to chemical energy, (allows life to exist)
Uses light energy to convert water and carbon dioxide to glucose and oxygen 
Glucose is important for the plants to survive, as well as any consumers
Plants are the bace of the food chain because of this
50% of all oxygen is made by plants
Most important
Provides food 
Provides oxygen 

Cellulose
Cellulose is a large and complex carbohydrate
Main component of cell walls
We use cellulose in many ways 
Cellulose from cotton to make fabric 
Cellulose from would pulp used for paper
We burn it for energy 

Food source
Important for the start of agriculture 




important for canadian society 
One in 7 jobs are in agriculture
10% of our gross income 
Maple syrup worth over 200 million

Food security 
Scientist predict by 2030, the global population will be over 8 billion
Issues is that we are running out of food for ppl 
Monoculture
Technology has been able to produce enough food for the growing demand 
Technology can provide treatment care fertilizer and pesticides 
Negative to this method
Planting one crop in the same area of soil repeatedly can deplete the soil of valuable nutrients 
This requires the input of synthetic fertilizers 
It is vulnerable to crop specific pest that has led to an increase in the use of pesticides
Farmers must bear economic cost 
Water quality in ground water, streams, and rivers are lowered
Sustainable agriculture
We are turning to sustainable agriculture
A method to meet the food demand without damaging the environment
Goal is to produce enough food while taking into account the economy and ecosystem
Crop rotation helps keep soil healthy 
Use of natural predators help keep pest populations under control. 














Plant as source of biochemicals
Plants produce chemical compounds for many purposes
Attract pollinators 
Repel threats (fungi, insects)
Medical use
Used plant extracts for medicinal purposes
A tea from plackberrry plants used to treat diarrhea
Helped european explorers treat scurvy (lack of vitamin C) by using evergreen bark and needles
25% of all prescription menicin contain plants
Example 
Rosy periwinkl huse impact on treatment of canser
Sorce of vincristine and vinblastine compounds to treat childhood leukemia and hodgkinâ€™s disease
Survival rate changed from 20% to higher than 90%
