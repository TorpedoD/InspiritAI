The people in my group were people of color that were rejected in canadian society, such as black, asian, russian, ets (basically people that were not white). The main distinction for my group was people of color were treated like “aliens” and therefore less than a human being. They were people that canada was trying to get rid of to make canada in to a “white country” they were denied access, and even with the slim chance that they do they must take on heavy punishment just because they are from a different race.

What were the unique struggles for your group?
Immigration Restrictions: The Immigration Act of 1924, also known as the Johnson-Reed Act, severely restricted immigration from Asia, Africa, and southern and eastern Europe. This made it much more difficult for immigrants of color to enter the United States and reunite with family members.
Language Barriers: Immigrants of color often faced language barriers when trying to communicate with English-speaking Americans. This made it difficult for them to find employment, access public services, and participate in their communities.
Cultural Differences: Immigrants of color often had different cultural traditions, values, and beliefs than mainstream American society. This sometimes led to misunderstandings, cultural clashes, and discrimination.


the Canadian government imposed strict immigration policies that discriminated against immigrants of colour. The Immigration Act of 1923 established a "continuous journey" provision, which required immigrants to arrive in Canada via a continuous journey from their country of origin. This provision targeted immigrants from Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean, immigrants of colour who were already living in Canada faced various forms of discrimination and segregation. For example, many were denied access to public services, including healthcare and education. They were also excluded from many job opportunities and faced lower wages than their white counterparts. Canadian authorities ignored the situation of immigrants of colour who were subjected to violence and harassment by white Canadians. In many cases, authorities failed to investigate or prosecute crimes against immigrants of colour, and some even condoned or participated in acts of violence.

the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which effectively banned Chinese immigration to Canada. This law was part of a broader effort to restrict non-European immigration to Canada and was based on the belief that Asian immigrants were unsuitable for life in Canada and threatened the economic and social well-being of the country. Other policies included the continuous journey requirement, which mandated that immigrants to Canada had to arrive on a direct voyage from their home country. These policies were clearly harmful to immigrants of colour and had lasting effects on their communities in Canada. The Chinese Immigration Act, for example, separated Chinese families and prevented them from being reunited in Canada.

Canada's immigration policies have become more inclusive, and immigrants of color have been able to settle and build lives in Canada. Today, immigrants of color make up a significant portion of Canada's population, and the government has made efforts to promote diversity and inclusion. Canada has also introduced programs to support the settlement and integration of immigrants, such as language training, employment support, and community services. Despite progress, immigrants of color still face challenges in Canada, including racism and discrimination. However, compared to the 1920s, the conditions for immigrants of color in Canada have improved significantly
